Based on the provided samples, it appears that the distribution of initial states follows these patterns:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent is always placed at position (1, 1) and facing right (direction 0).
2. **Goal Placement**: The goal can be placed in multiple positions, but it seems to be more likely to appear in certain regions of the grid, particularly in the bottom-right quadrant.
3. **Grid Layout**: The grid is mostly empty with walls forming the boundaries. There are occasional internal walls or obstacles, but they are not consistent across all samples.

To improve the model, we will:
- Ensure the agent is always placed at (1, 1) and facing right.
- Randomly place the goal in a wider range of possible positions, including those observed in the real-world samples.
- Keep the grid layout as empty with walls, but allow for some variability in internal structures.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    def place_goal():
        # Define a wider range of possible positions for the goal
        possible_positions = [
            (x, y) for x in range(1, empty_state.width - 1) for y in range(1, empty_state.height - 1)
            if empty_state.grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty
        ]
        goal_pos = possible_positions[np.random.choice(len(possible_positions))]
        empty_state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    def place_agent():
        # Place the agent at a fixed position
        empty_state.agent_pos = (1, 1)
        empty_state.agent_dir = 0
        empty_state.carrying = None

    place_goal()
    place_agent()

    return empty_state
```

This function ensures that the goal is placed in a wider range of possible positions, making the distribution more closely match the real-world samples. The agent's position and direction remain fixed as required.
