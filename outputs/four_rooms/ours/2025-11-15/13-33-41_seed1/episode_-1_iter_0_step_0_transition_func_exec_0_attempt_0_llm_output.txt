### Explanation:
The `transition_func` function models the distribution of next states conditioned on actions and previous states in the following way:

1. **Direction Rotation**:
   - If the action is to turn left or right, the agent's direction is updated accordingly by rotating it 90 degrees in the respective direction.

2. **Move Forward**:
   - If the action is to move forward, the function calculates the new position by adding the direction vector to the current position.
   - If the new position is out of bounds or hits a wall, the agent stays in the same position.
   - Otherwise, the agent moves to the new position.

3. **Other Actions**:
   - For simplicity, actions like picking up, dropping, toggling, and completing the task are not implemented in this function. These actions would require additional logic to handle interactions with objects in the grid.

The function returns a new `MinigridState` object with the updated agent position, direction, and grid. The grid itself remains unchanged for now, but it could be modified if actions like picking up or dropping objects were implemented.
