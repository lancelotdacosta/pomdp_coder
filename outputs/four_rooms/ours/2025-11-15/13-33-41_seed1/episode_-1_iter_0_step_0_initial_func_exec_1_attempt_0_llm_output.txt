The error you're encountering is due to the `np.random.choice` function expecting a 1-dimensional array, but you are providing a list of tuples. To fix this, we need to randomly select one of the tuples directly without using `np.random.choice`.

Here's the corrected implementation of `initial_func`:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # The agent always starts at position (1, 1) facing right (direction 0) and not carrying anything
    agent_pos = (1, 1)
    agent_dir = 0
    carrying = None

    # The goal is to place the key in a random valid position
    key_positions = [
        (12, 8), (11, 12), (12, 13), (10, 9)
    ]  # Sample positions where keys can be placed based on provided samples

    # Randomly select one of the key positions
    key_pos = key_positions[np.random.randint(len(key_positions))]

    # Place the key in the selected position
    empty_state.grid[key_pos] = ObjectTypes.key

    # Return the initial state with the agent and the key placed
    return MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=carrying
    )
```

In this corrected version, `np.random.randint` is used to generate a random index within the range of the `key_positions` list, and then that index is used to select a key position. This avoids the error caused by passing a list of tuples to `np.random.choice`.
