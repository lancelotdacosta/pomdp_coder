The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `np.random.choice` expects a 1-dimensional array, but `valid_positions` is a list of tuples. To fix this, we need to ensure that we are passing a 1-dimensional array to `np.random.choice`. One way to do this is to use `np.random.choice` to select an index from the list of valid positions.

Here's the corrected version of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Ensure the agent is at the starting position
    agent_pos = (1, 1)
    agent_dir = 0
    carrying = None

    # Place the goal object in a valid position
    def is_valid_position(pos):
        x, y = pos
        return empty_state.grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty

    valid_positions = [
        (x, y) for x in range(empty_state.width) for y in range(empty_state.height)
        if is_valid_position((x, y))
    ]

    if valid_positions:
        # Randomly select an index from the list of valid positions
        goal_pos = valid_positions[np.random.choice(len(valid_positions))]
    else:
        raise ValueError("No valid positions found for placing the goal object.")

    # Create the initial state
    grid = empty_state.grid.copy()
    grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=carrying
    )

    return initial_state
```

### Explanation:
1. **Valid Position Check**: The `is_valid_position` function checks if a given position is empty.
2. **List of Valid Positions**: We generate a list of all valid positions where the goal object can be placed.
3. **Random Selection**: Instead of directly using `np.random.choice` on the list of tuples, we use it to select an index from the range of valid positions. This ensures that `np.random.choice` is called with a 1-dimensional array.
4. **Error Handling**: If no valid positions are found, a `ValueError` is raised to indicate the issue.

This should resolve the error and allow the function to correctly place the goal object in a valid position.
