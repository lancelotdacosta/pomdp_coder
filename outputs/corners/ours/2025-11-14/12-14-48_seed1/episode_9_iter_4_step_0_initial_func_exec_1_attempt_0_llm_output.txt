The error originates from the use of `np.random.choice` on a list of tuples (`possible_positions`). The `np.random.choice` function expects a 1-dimensional array, but it is receiving a list of tuples. To fix this, we can use `np.random.choice` to select an index from a 1-dimensional array and then use that index to select the corresponding tuple from `possible_positions`.

Here's the corrected `initial_func`:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define the dimensions of the grid
    width, height = empty_state.grid.shape

    # Ensure the grid is empty except for the walls
    empty_state.grid[1:-1, 1:-1] = ObjectTypes.empty

    # Place a goal object at a random position on the grid
    goal_pos = (np.random.randint(1, width - 1), np.random.randint(1, height - 1))
    empty_state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Define the possible positions for the agent
    possible_positions = [
        (x, y)
        for x in range(1, width - 1)
        for y in range(1, height - 1)
        if empty_state.grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty
    ]

    # Select a random initial position for the agent
    if possible_positions:
        idx = np.random.choice(len(possible_positions))
        agent_pos = possible_positions[idx]
    else:
        raise ValueError("No valid positions available for the agent")

    # Set the agent's position on the grid
    empty_state.agent_pos = agent_pos

    # Set the agent's direction randomly
    empty_state.agent_dir = np.random.randint(0, 4)

    # Ensure the agent is not carrying anything initially
    empty_state.carrying = None

    return empty_state
```

### Explanation:
1. **Grid Initialization**: The grid is initialized to be empty except for the walls.
2. **Goal Placement**: A goal object is placed at a random position on the grid.
3. **Possible Agent Positions**: A list of possible positions for the agent is generated by iterating over the grid and checking if the cell is empty.
4. **Agent Position Selection**: If there are valid positions available, an index is randomly selected from the list of possible positions. This index is used to select the agent's starting position.
5. **Agent Direction**: The agent's direction is set randomly.
6. **Agent Carrying**: The agent is initially not carrying anything.

This ensures that the `np.random.choice` function is used correctly with a 1-dimensional array (list of indices) and avoids the error.
