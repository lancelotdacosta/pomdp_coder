### Explanation of the Distribution of Initial States

The distribution of initial states appears to have the following characteristics:

1. **Agent Positions**: The agent can start at various positions within the grid, such as (5, 1), (2, 1), (6, 8), (6, 4), and (5, 3). These positions are within the open area of the grid and not on walls.

2. **Agent Directions**: The agent can start facing either right (0) or left (2).

3. **Grid Contents**: The grid is primarily composed of empty cells (1) and walls (2). There are no other objects present in the initial states provided.

The `initial_func` function models this distribution by:
- Randomly selecting an agent position from a predefined list of possible positions.
- Randomly selecting an agent direction from a predefined list of possible directions.
- Ensuring the selected position is not a wall before placing the agent in the grid.
- Returning the initialized state with the agent placed in the grid.
