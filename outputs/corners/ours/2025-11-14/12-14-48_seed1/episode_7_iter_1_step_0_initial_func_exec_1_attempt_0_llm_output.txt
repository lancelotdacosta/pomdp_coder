The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `np.random.choice` expects a 1-dimensional array, but you are passing a list of tuples. To fix this, you can use a different approach to randomly select an element from a list of tuples.

Here's the corrected version of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """

    # Define the possible agent positions and directions
    possible_agent_positions = [
        (3, 3), (5, 3), (6, 2)
    ]
    possible_agent_directions = [0, 1, 2, 3]

    # Randomly select an agent position and direction
    agent_pos = possible_agent_positions[np.random.choice(len(possible_agent_positions))]
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(possible_agent_directions)

    # Define the possible goal positions
    possible_goal_positions = [
        (8, 1), (9, 8), (8, 8)
    ]

    # Randomly select a goal position
    goal_pos = possible_goal_positions[np.random.choice(len(possible_goal_positions))]

    # Place the goal in the grid
    empty_state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return initial_state
```

### Explanation of the Changes

1. **Agent Position Selection**:
   - Instead of using `np.random.choice` directly on the list of tuples, we use `np.random.choice` to select an index from the range of the length of the list.
   - We then use this index to select the corresponding tuple from the list.

2. **Goal Position Selection**:
   - Similarly, for the goal position, we use `np.random.choice` to select an index and then use this index to select the corresponding tuple from the list of possible goal positions.

These changes ensure that the function works correctly by selecting a random element from the lists of tuples.
