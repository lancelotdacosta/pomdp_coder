Based on the provided samples, I believe the distribution of initial states can be described as follows:

1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 10x10 with walls on all four sides.
2. **Agent Position**: The agent's starting position seems to be uniformly distributed within the inner 8x8 grid (excluding the outer walls).
3. **Agent Direction**: The agent's direction (facing right, down, left, or up) seems to be uniformly distributed.
4. **Carrying**: The agent does not carry any objects initially.
5. **Goal Object**: There is a goal object (`10`) placed at a random position within the inner 8x8 grid, excluding the position of the agent.

Given this understanding, here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define the inner grid dimensions (excluding walls)
    inner_width = empty_state.width - 2
    inner_height = empty_state.height - 2

    # Randomly place the agent within the inner grid
    agent_x = np.random.randint(1, inner_width + 1)
    agent_y = np.random.randint(1, inner_height + 1)
    agent_pos = (agent_x, agent_y)

    # Randomly choose the agent's direction
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # Randomly place the goal object within the inner grid, ensuring it is not at the agent's position
    goal_x, goal_y = agent_pos
    while (goal_x, goal_y) == agent_pos:
        goal_x = np.random.randint(1, inner_width + 1)
        goal_y = np.random.randint(1, inner_height + 1)
    
    empty_state.grid[goal_x, goal_y] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Create the initial state
    state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return state
```

This function ensures that:
- The agent is placed randomly within the inner 8x8 grid.
- The agent's direction is chosen randomly from the four possible directions.
- The goal object is placed randomly within the inner 8x8 grid, ensuring it does not overlap with the agent's position.
- The initial state is returned with the updated grid and agent properties.
