The observed distribution of initial states suggests that:

1. The agent can be placed at various positions within the grid, but primarily in areas that are not near the walls.
2. The agent's direction (facing right, down, left, or up) is uniformly random.
3. The goal object can be placed anywhere in the grid except on walls, and it should not overlap with the agent's starting position.

To better model this distribution, we need to ensure that the agent's starting position and the goal's position are chosen from a wider range of valid positions. Additionally, we should ensure that the agent does not start on the same tile as the goal.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define the possible starting positions and directions
    possible_agent_positions = [
        (x, y)
        for x in range(1, empty_state.width - 1)
        for y in range(1, empty_state.height - 1)
        if empty_state.grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty
    ]
    possible_agent_directions = [0, 1, 2, 3]

    # Randomly select a starting position and direction
    agent_pos = random.choice(possible_agent_positions)
    agent_dir = random.choice(possible_agent_directions)

    # Place the goal object randomly in the grid, ensuring it does not overlap with the agent
    goal_position = (np.random.randint(1, empty_state.width - 1), np.random.randint(1, empty_state.height - 1))
    while empty_state.grid[goal_position] != ObjectTypes.empty or goal_position == agent_pos:
        goal_position = (np.random.randint(1, empty_state.width - 1), np.random.randint(1, empty_state.height - 1))

    # Update the grid with the goal object
    empty_state.grid[goal_position] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return initial_state
```

This function ensures that the agent can start at any valid position within the grid (excluding the walls) and that the goal is placed in a valid position that does not overlap with the agent's starting position. This should better match the observed distribution of initial states.
