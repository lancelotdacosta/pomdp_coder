The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `np.random.choice` expects a 1-dimensional array, but `valid_positions` is a list of tuples. To fix this, we can use `np.random.choice` to select an index from the list of valid positions and then use that index to get the corresponding position.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Extract the grid dimensions
    width, height = empty_state.width, empty_state.height

    # Find all possible positions for the agent (excluding walls and goal)
    valid_positions = [
        (x, y) for x in range(width) for y in range(height)
        if empty_state.grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty
    ]

    # Randomly select an index from the list of valid positions
    idx = np.random.choice(len(valid_positions))

    # Get the agent position using the selected index
    agent_pos = valid_positions[idx]

    # Randomly select an agent direction (0: right, 1: down, 2: left, 3: up)
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # Ensure the agent is not carrying any object initially
    carrying = None

    # Create the initial state with the selected agent position and direction
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=carrying
    )

    return initial_state
```

### Explanation:
1. **Extract Grid Dimensions**: We extract the width and height of the grid from the `empty_state`.
2. **Find Valid Positions**: We create a list of valid positions where the agent can start. These positions are cells in the grid that are empty (not walls or the goal).
3. **Select a Random Index**: We use `np.random.choice` to select a random index from the list of valid positions.
4. **Get Agent Position**: We use the selected index to get the corresponding position for the agent.
5. **Select Agent Direction**: We randomly select an agent direction from the list of possible directions.
6. **Ensure Agent is Not Carrying**: We set the `carrying` attribute to `None` since the agent does not carry any objects initially.
7. **Create Initial State**: We create and return the initial state with the selected agent position, direction, and the copied grid.

This should resolve the `ValueError` and allow your code to run correctly.
