The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `np.random.choice` expects a 1-dimensional array as input, but you are providing it with a list of tuples. To resolve this, you can use a different approach to randomly select a tuple from the list.

Here's the corrected `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    grid = empty_state.grid.copy()
    width, height = grid.shape

    # Define the possible positions for the goal object
    goal_positions = [(8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 7), (8, 9)]

    # Randomly select a position for the goal object
    goal_pos = goal_positions[np.random.choice(len(goal_positions))]
    grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Define the possible positions for the agent
    agent_positions = [
        (6, 2),
        (3, 3),
        (6, 8),
        (5, 3),
        (4, 3),
        (2, 2),
        (2, 3),
        (2, 8),
        (7, 2),
        (7, 3),
        (7, 8)
    ]

    # Randomly select a position and direction for the agent
    agent_pos = agent_positions[np.random.choice(len(agent_positions))]
    agent_dir = np.random.randint(0, 4)

    # Create the initial state with the agent and goal positions
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return initial_state
```

### Explanation of the Changes

1. **Selecting Goal Position**:
   - Instead of using `np.random.choice` directly on the list of tuples, we use `np.random.choice` to select an index from the range of the list length.
   - We then use this index to select the corresponding tuple from the list.

2. **Selecting Agent Position**:
   - Similarly, for the agent's position, we use `np.random.choice` to select an index from the range of the list length and then use this index to select the corresponding tuple from the list.

This ensures that the input to `np.random.choice` is a 1-dimensional array (in this case, an array of indices), which resolves the error.
