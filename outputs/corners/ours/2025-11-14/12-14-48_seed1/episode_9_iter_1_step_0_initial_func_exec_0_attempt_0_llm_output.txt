Based on the provided samples, it appears that the distribution of initial states is as follows:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent can start at various positions within the grid, but it seems to avoid the walls and certain specific locations (like the goal location).
2. **Agent Direction**: The agent can start facing any direction (right, down, left, up).
3. **Carrying**: The agent does not carry any objects initially.
4. **Grid**: The grid has walls around the edges, and there is a goal object (represented by `10`) in one of the cells. The goal object's position is consistent across the samples.

Given this, we can model the initial state distribution by randomly selecting an agent position and direction, ensuring the agent does not start on a wall or the goal. Here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Extract the grid dimensions
    width, height = empty_state.width, empty_state.height

    # Find all possible positions for the agent (excluding walls and goal)
    valid_positions = [
        (x, y) for x in range(width) for y in range(height)
        if empty_state.grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty
    ]

    # Randomly select an agent position from the valid positions
    agent_pos = np.random.choice(valid_positions)

    # Randomly select an agent direction (0: right, 1: down, 2: left, 3: up)
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # Ensure the agent is not carrying any object initially
    carrying = None

    # Create the initial state with the selected agent position and direction
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=carrying
    )

    return initial_state
```

This function ensures that the agent starts in a valid empty cell, facing a random direction, and does not carry any objects. The grid remains unchanged except for the agent's position.
