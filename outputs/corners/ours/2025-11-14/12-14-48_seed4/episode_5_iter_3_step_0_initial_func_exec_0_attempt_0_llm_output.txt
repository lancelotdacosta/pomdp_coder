Based on the samples from the real world, it seems that the distribution of initial states has the following characteristics:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent can be placed at any free (non-wall) position in the grid.
2. **Agent Direction**: The agent can face any of the four cardinal directions (right, down, left, up).
3. **Goal Object**: The goal object is placed at a random free (non-wall) position in the grid, independent of the agent's position.
4. **Empty Grid**: The grid is initially empty except for the walls, which are pre-filled.

The provided code already covers these points, but there might be some subtle issues. Let's ensure that the agent and goal positions are truly independent and that the grid is properly initialized.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """

    def random_free_position(grid):
        while True:
            x = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[0] - 1)
            y = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[1] - 1)
            if grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
                return (x, y)

    def random_direction():
        return np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # Create a copy of the empty state to modify
    state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),
        agent_pos=(0, 0),
        agent_dir=0,
        carrying=None
    )

    # Place the agent in a random free position
    state.agent_pos = random_free_position(state.grid)
    state.agent_dir = random_direction()

    # Place a single goal object in a random free position
    goal_pos = random_free_position(state.grid)
    state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    return state
```

### Explanation of Improvements:
1. **Agent and Goal Placement**: The `random_free_position` function ensures that both the agent and the goal are placed in truly random and independent positions within the grid. This function continues to generate random positions until it finds a free (non-wall) location.
2. **Agent Direction**: The `random_direction` function ensures that the agent's direction is chosen randomly from the four possible directions.
3. **Grid Initialization**: The grid is initialized as a copy of the empty state, which already has the walls pre-filled. This ensures that the walls are not modified during the placement of the agent and the goal.

This implementation should better model the true distribution of initial states based on the provided real-world samples.
