To better model the true distribution of initial states, let's analyze the provided samples. The key observations are:

1. **Goal Position**: The goal position is placed randomly within the grid, avoiding walls.
2. **Agent Position**: The agent's position is also placed randomly within the grid, avoiding walls and the goal position.
3. **Agent Direction**: The agent's direction is chosen uniformly at random.
4. **Grid Layout**: The grid is mostly empty with walls around the perimeter.

The main issue in the previous implementation was that the agent's position and goal position were being placed independently, which could lead to the agent starting on the goal or on a wall. We need to ensure that the agent does not start on the goal or a wall.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define the goal position randomly within the grid, avoiding walls
    while True:
        goal_x, goal_y = np.random.randint(1, 9), np.random.randint(1, 9)
        if empty_state.grid[goal_x, goal_y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
            break
    empty_state.grid[goal_x, goal_y] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Define the agent's initial position and direction, ensuring it does not overlap with the goal
    while True:
        agent_x, agent_y = np.random.randint(1, 9), np.random.randint(1, 9)
        if empty_state.grid[agent_x, agent_y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
            break
    agent_dir = np.random.randint(4)

    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),
        agent_pos=(agent_x, agent_y),
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return initial_state
```

### Explanation

1. **Goal Position**: We use a `while` loop to ensure that the goal position is placed in an empty cell and not on a wall.
2. **Agent Position**: We use another `while` loop to ensure that the agent's position is placed in an empty cell and not on the goal or a wall.
3. **Agent Direction**: The agent's direction is chosen uniformly at random using `np.random.randint(4)`.
4. **Grid Layout**: The grid is pre-filled with walls around the perimeter, and the rest of the cells are initially empty.

This approach ensures that the initial state is more consistent with the provided samples and avoids placing the agent on the goal or a wall.
