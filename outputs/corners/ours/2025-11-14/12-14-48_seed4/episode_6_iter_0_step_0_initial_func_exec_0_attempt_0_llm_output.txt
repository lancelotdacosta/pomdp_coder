Based on the provided samples, the distribution of initial states seems to have the following characteristics:

1. **Grid Layout**: The grid is a 10x10 grid with walls around the perimeter. There may be a goal object (represented by `10`) at various positions within the grid.
2. **Agent Position**: The agent can start at various positions within the grid, but it seems to avoid the walls and the goal object.
3. **Agent Direction**: The agent's initial direction is randomly chosen from the four possible directions (right, down, left, up).
4. **Carrying Object**: The agent does not carry any object initially.

Given this, the `initial_func` function should model the distribution of initial states by placing the agent at a random valid position, setting a random direction, and ensuring that the grid has walls around the perimeter and a goal object at a random position.

Here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Ensure the grid has walls around the perimeter
    grid = empty_state.grid

    # Place the goal object at a random valid position
    while True:
        goal_x, goal_y = np.random.randint(1, 9), np.random.randint(1, 9)
        if grid[goal_x, goal_y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
            grid[goal_x, goal_y] = ObjectTypes.goal
            break

    # Place the agent at a random valid position (not on the goal or the walls)
    while True:
        agent_x, agent_y = np.random.randint(1, 9), np.random.randint(1, 9)
        if grid[agent_x, agent_y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
            grid[agent_x, agent_y] = ObjectTypes.agent
            break

    # Set a random direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # Create the initial state
    state = MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=(agent_x, agent_y),
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return state
```

This function ensures that the grid is correctly set up with walls around the perimeter, places a goal object at a random valid position, and places the agent at a random valid position (not on the goal or the walls). The agent's direction is also randomly chosen from the four possible directions.
