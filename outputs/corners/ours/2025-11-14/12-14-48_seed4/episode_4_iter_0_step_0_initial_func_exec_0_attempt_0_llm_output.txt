Based on the provided samples, the distribution of initial states can be described as follows:

1. **Grid Layout**:
   - The grid is a 10x10 grid with walls around the perimeter (value `2`).
   - There is a goal object (value `10`) located at various positions within the grid.

2. **Agent Position and Direction**:
   - The agent's initial position (`agent_pos`) is randomly distributed within the grid, but not on the walls or the goal.
   - The agent's initial direction (`agent_dir`) is uniformly random, with possible values `[0, 1, 2, 3]`.

3. **Carrying**:
   - The agent is not carrying any object initially (`carrying=None`).

Given this understanding, we can implement the `initial_func` to sample an initial state from this distribution.

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define the goal position randomly within the grid, avoiding walls
    goal_x, goal_y = np.random.randint(1, 9), np.random.randint(1, 9)
    empty_state.grid[goal_x, goal_y] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Define the agent's initial position and direction
    while True:
        agent_x, agent_y = np.random.randint(1, 9), np.random.randint(1, 9)
        if empty_state.grid[agent_x, agent_y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
            break
    agent_dir = np.random.randint(4)

    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),
        agent_pos=(agent_x, agent_y),
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return initial_state
```

This function first places a goal object at a random position within the grid, ensuring it is not on the walls. It then selects a random position for the agent, ensuring it is not on the walls or the goal. Finally, it sets a random direction for the agent and returns the initial state.
