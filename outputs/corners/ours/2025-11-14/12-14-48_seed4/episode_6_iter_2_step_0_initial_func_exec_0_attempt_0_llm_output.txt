Based on the provided samples, the distribution of initial states seems to have the following characteristics:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent can start at various positions within the grid, but it typically starts at positions that are not walls or obstacles. It is more common for the agent to start at positions that are not directly adjacent to the walls.

2. **Agent Direction**: The agent can start facing any direction (right, down, left, up) with equal probability.

3. **Grid Layout**: The grid layout is consistent across all samples, with the outermost layer being walls (value 2). There is a single goal object (value 10) placed at different positions in different initial states.

4. **Carrying**: The agent does not carry any object initially (`carrying=None`).

Given these observations, we can implement the `initial_func` function to model the distribution of initial states. The function will randomly place the agent and the goal object within the grid, while ensuring that the agent does not start on a wall or the goal object.
