Based on the provided samples, it seems that the agent and the goal object can be placed anywhere in the grid except the walls. The agent's direction is also randomly chosen. However, there are some observations that suggest a more nuanced distribution:

1. **Agent and Goal Placement**: Both the agent and the goal object are placed randomly within the inner grid (excluding the walls).
2. **Agent Direction**: The agent's direction is uniformly random.
3. **Grid Layout**: The grid is consistent with walls around the perimeter and empty cells in the interior.

To better model this distribution, we need to ensure that both the agent and the goal object are placed in valid positions (i.e., not on the walls) and that the agent's direction is chosen randomly.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """

    def random_free_position(grid):
        while True:
            x = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[0] - 1)
            y = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[1] - 1)
            if grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
                return (x, y)

    def random_direction():
        return np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # Create a copy of the empty state to modify
    state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),
        agent_pos=(0, 0),
        agent_dir=0,
        carrying=None
    )

    # Place the agent in a random free position
    state.agent_pos = random_free_position(state.grid)
    state.agent_dir = random_direction()

    # Place a single goal object in a random free position
    goal_pos = random_free_position(state.grid)
    state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    return state
```

### Explanation:
1. **Random Free Position**: The `random_free_position` function ensures that both the agent and the goal are placed in valid positions within the inner grid (excluding the walls). It checks if the chosen position is empty before placing the agent or goal.
2. **Random Direction**: The `random_direction` function randomly selects one of the four possible directions for the agent.
3. **State Initialization**: The `state` is initialized with a copy of the `empty_state` grid, and the agent's position and direction are set based on the random free position and random direction functions.

This implementation should better match the observed distribution of initial states in the real world.
