It looks like there was a small syntax error in the function name `is Done`. The space between `is` and `Done` should be removed. Additionally, I'll ensure that the function names are clear and follow Python naming conventions. Here is the corrected version of the `reward_func`:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (MinigridState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (MinigridState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """

    def is_goal_reached(state):
        # Check if the agent is on the goal cell
        return state.grid[state.agent_pos] == ObjectTypes.goal

    def is_episode_done(state, next_state):
        # Check if the episode is done
        return is_goal_reached(next_state)

    reward = 0
    done = False

    if action == Actions.forward:
        # If the action is forward, check if the agent moved to a new position
        if state.agent_pos != next_state.agent_pos:
            # If the agent moved to a new position, check if it reached the goal
            if is_goal_reached(next_state):
                reward = 1
                done = True
            else:
                reward = 0
                done = False
    elif action in [Actions.left, Actions.right]:
        # If the action is turning, no reward and episode is not done
        reward = 0
        done = False
    elif action == Actions.pickup or action == Actions.drop or action == Actions.toggle:
        # If the action is pickup, drop, or toggle, no reward and episode is not done
        reward = 0
        done = False
    elif action == Actions.done:
        # If the action is done, check if the goal is reached
        if is_goal_reached(next_state):
            reward = 1
            done = True
        else:
            reward = 0
            done = False

    return reward, done
```

This should resolve the syntax error and ensure that the function names are valid.
