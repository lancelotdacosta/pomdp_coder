### Explanation of the Distribution of Initial States

The distribution of initial states appears to be as follows:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent starts at a random free position within the grid, excluding the walls.
2. **Agent Direction**: The agent's initial direction is chosen randomly from one of the four possible directions (right, down, left, up).
3. **Goal Object**: A single goal object is placed at a random free position within the grid, excluding the walls and the agent's initial position.

This distribution ensures that the environment is varied and unpredictable, providing a diverse set of initial conditions for the agent to explore.
