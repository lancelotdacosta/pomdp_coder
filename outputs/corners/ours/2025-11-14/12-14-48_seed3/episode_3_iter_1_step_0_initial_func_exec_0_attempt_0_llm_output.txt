To better model the true distribution of initial states, we need to ensure that the agent and goal positions are placed in a way that reflects the real-world samples. From the provided samples, it appears that:

1. The agent and goal positions are placed randomly within the empty cells of the grid.
2. The agent can be placed anywhere in the grid where there is an empty cell.
3. The goal can be placed anywhere in the grid where there is an empty cell, including the same position as the agent (though this is less likely).

Given this, we need to update the `initial_func` function to ensure that the agent and goal positions are sampled from the set of all empty cells. Here's the improved code:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    
    def random_pos(grid: NDArray[np.int8]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """Generate a random position within the grid that is not a wall."""
        while True:
            x, y = np.random.randint(1, 9), np.random.randint(1, 8)
            if grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
                return (x, y)
    
    def random_dir() -> int:
        """Generate a random direction for the agent."""
        return np.random.choice([0, 1, 2, 3])
    
    # Copy the empty state to avoid modifying it
    state = MinigridState(
        grid=np.copy(empty_state.grid),
        agent_pos=None,
        agent_dir=None,
        carrying=None
    )
    
    # Get all empty positions in the grid
    empty_positions = [(x, y) for x in range(1, state.width - 1) for y in range(1, state.height - 1) if state.grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty]
    
    # Place the goal object randomly in the grid
    goal_pos = np.random.choice(empty_positions)
    state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal
    
    # Remove the goal position from the list of empty positions
    empty_positions.remove(goal_pos)
    
    # Place the agent randomly in the grid
    agent_pos = np.random.choice(empty_positions)
    state.agent_pos = agent_pos
    
    # Set a random direction for the agent
    state.agent_dir = random_dir()
    
    return state
```

This updated function ensures that:
- The agent and goal positions are sampled from all empty cells.
- The goal and agent positions are distinct unless the real distribution allows them to be the same (which is less likely and can be adjusted if needed).

This should better reflect the true distribution of initial states in the environment.
