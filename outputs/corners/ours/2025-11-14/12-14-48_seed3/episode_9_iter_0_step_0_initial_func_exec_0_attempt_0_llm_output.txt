Based on the provided samples, the distribution of initial states suggests that:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent can start at any position within the grid, except for walls and goal positions.
2. **Agent Direction**: The agent can face any direction (0: right, 1: down, 2: left, 3: up).
3. **Carrying**: The agent does not carry any object initially.
4. **Grid**: The grid is mostly empty (filled with `1`), with walls (`2`) around the borders and a single goal (`10`) placed at various positions.

Here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function to model the distribution of initial states:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    
    def sample_position(grid):
        """Sample a random valid position for the agent."""
        while True:
            x = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[0] - 1)
            y = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[1] - 1)
            if grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
                return (x, y)
    
    def sample_direction():
        """Sample a random direction for the agent."""
        return np.random.choice(list(Direction))
    
    def place_goal(grid):
        """Place a goal at a random valid position in the grid."""
        while True:
            x = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[0] - 1)
            y = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[1] - 1)
            if grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
                grid[x, y] = ObjectTypes.goal
                return (x, y)
    
    # Place the goal
    goal_pos = place_goal(empty_state.grid)
    
    # Sample agent position and direction
    agent_pos = sample_position(empty_state.grid)
    agent_dir = sample_direction()
    
    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
    
    return initial_state
```

This function ensures that the agent starts at a random valid position (not on a wall or goal), faces a random direction, and the grid contains a single goal placed at a random valid position. The `empty_state` is used as the base grid with walls pre-filled.
