To better model the true distribution of initial states, we need to ensure that the agent and the goal are placed in a way that is more consistent with the observed samples. Specifically, the agent and the goal should be placed in a more diverse set of positions and directions.

The observed samples show that:
1. The agent can be placed at various positions within the grid, away from the walls.
2. The agent's direction can be any of the four possible directions.
3. The goal can be placed at any empty position within the grid, away from the walls and the agent's position.

To improve the `initial_func` function, we will:
1. Ensure that the agent is placed at a random empty position within the grid, away from the walls.
2. Ensure that the agent's direction is randomly chosen from the four possible directions.
3. Place the goal at a random empty position within the grid, ensuring it is not the same as the agent's position.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    
    def random_position(grid):
        """Generate a random position that is not a wall and not a goal."""
        while True:
            x = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[0] - 1)
            y = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[1] - 1)
            if grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
                return (x, y)

    def random_direction():
        """Generate a random direction for the agent."""
        return np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # Generate a random position for the agent
    agent_pos = random_position(empty_state.grid)

    # Generate a random direction for the agent
    agent_dir = random_direction()

    # Place the goal at a random position (not on walls or where the agent is)
    goal_pos = random_position(empty_state.grid)
    while goal_pos == agent_pos:
        goal_pos = random_position(empty_state.grid)
    empty_state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Return the initial state
    return MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
```

This function ensures that the agent and the goal are placed in a diverse set of positions and directions, which should better match the observed distribution of initial states.
