Based on the provided samples, it seems that the initial states are characterized by:

1. The agent is placed at a random position within the grid, usually not on the walls or the goal location.
2. The agent's direction (facing) is chosen randomly from the four possible directions: right (0), down (1), left (2), or up (3).
3. The agent is not carrying any object (`carrying=None`).
4. The grid is mostly empty with walls around the perimeter and a single goal location (object type 10) somewhere inside the grid.

Given this understanding, we can implement the `initial_func` to generate such initial states.

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    def random_position(grid):
        while True:
            x = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[0] - 1)
            y = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[1] - 1)
            if grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
                return (x, y)

    def random_direction():
        return np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # Place the goal in a random empty cell inside the grid
    goal_pos = random_position(empty_state.grid)
    empty_state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Place the agent in a random empty cell inside the grid
    agent_pos = random_position(empty_state.grid)
    agent_dir = random_direction()

    # Ensure the agent position is not on the goal
    while agent_pos == goal_pos:
        agent_pos = random_position(empty_state.grid)

    return MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
```

This implementation ensures that the initial state is generated according to the observed distribution:
- The agent's position and direction are randomly chosen.
- The goal is placed in a random empty cell within the grid.
- The agent is not placed on the goal or any walls.
