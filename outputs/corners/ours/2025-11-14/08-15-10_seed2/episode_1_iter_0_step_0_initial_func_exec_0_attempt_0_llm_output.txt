Based on the provided samples, it appears that the initial state distribution has the following characteristics:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent can start at various positions within the grid, but it is generally placed in the open area of the grid (not on walls or goal positions).
2. **Agent Direction**: The agent's direction is uniformly distributed among the four possible directions (right, down, left, up).
3. **Goal Position**: The goal (represented by 10) is placed at various positions within the grid, but it is not placed on the walls.
4. **Carrying**: The agent does not carry any object initially.

Given these observations, we can model the initial state distribution as follows:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    
    def random_position(grid):
        """Generate a random position that is not a wall and not a goal."""
        while True:
            x = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[0] - 1)
            y = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[1] - 1)
            if grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
                return (x, y)

    def random_direction():
        """Generate a random direction for the agent."""
        return np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # Generate a random position for the agent
    agent_pos = random_position(empty_state.grid)

    # Generate a random direction for the agent
    agent_dir = random_direction()

    # Place the goal at a random position (not on walls or where the agent is)
    goal_pos = random_position(empty_state.grid)
    while goal_pos == agent_pos:
        goal_pos = random_position(empty_state.grid)
    empty_state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Return the initial state
    return MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
```

This implementation ensures that:
- The agent's position is chosen from the open cells in the grid.
- The agent's direction is uniformly random.
- The goal position is chosen from the open cells in the grid and is not the same as the agent's position.
- The agent does not carry any object initially.
