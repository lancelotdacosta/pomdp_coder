### Explanation of the Distribution of Initial States

The distribution of initial states in this environment appears to be characterized by:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent can start at any empty cell within the grid, excluding the outer walls. The samples provided show the agent starting at various positions within the inner part of the grid.
2. **Agent Direction**: The agent's direction is randomly chosen from the four possible directions (right, down, left, up). The samples provided show the agent facing different directions.
3. **Grid Configuration**: The grid itself is a 10x10 grid with walls along the boundary and empty cells inside. There are no other objects (like goals, keys, or doors) in the grid.

The `initial_func` function ensures that the agent is placed in a valid empty cell and given a random direction, which matches the observed distribution of initial states.
