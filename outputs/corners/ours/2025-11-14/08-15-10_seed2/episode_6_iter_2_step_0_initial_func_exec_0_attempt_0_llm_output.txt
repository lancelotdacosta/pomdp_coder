Based on the provided samples, it appears that the goal can appear in any cell inside the grid, not just in cells adjacent to the agent. The agent itself can also be placed in any empty cell, ensuring it is not on top of the goal. The direction of the agent is random and can be any of the four possible directions (right, down, left, up).

To improve the `initial_func` function to better model the true distribution, we need to ensure that both the goal and the agent can be placed in any valid empty cell, and that the agent's position is not the same as the goal's position.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    def random_position(grid):
        while True:
            x = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[0] - 1)
            y = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[1] - 1)
            if grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
                return (x, y)

    def random_direction():
        return np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # Place the goal in a random empty cell inside the grid
    goal_pos = random_position(empty_state.grid)
    empty_state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Place the agent in a random empty cell inside the grid
    agent_pos = random_position(empty_state.grid)
    agent_dir = random_direction()

    # Ensure the agent position is not on the goal
    while agent_pos == goal_pos:
        agent_pos = random_position(empty_state.grid)

    return MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
```

This function ensures that both the goal and the agent can be placed anywhere in the grid where there is an empty cell, and that the agent's position is not the same as the goal's position. The agent's direction is chosen randomly from the four possible directions. This should better match the true distribution of initial states based on the provided samples.
