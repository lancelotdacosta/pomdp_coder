The error you are encountering is due to the variable `grid` not being defined in the scope of the `initial_func` function. To fix this, we need to ensure that `grid` is properly referenced. In this context, `grid` should be `empty_state.grid`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    def random_position(grid):
        while True:
            x = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[0] - 1)
            y = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[1] - 1)
            if grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
                return (x, y)

    def random_direction():
        return np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # Place the goal in a random empty cell inside the grid, biased towards the edges
    goal_bias = 0.7  # Higher probability of placing the goal near the edges
    if np.random.rand() < goal_bias:
        # Place the goal near the edges
        edge = np.random.choice(['top', 'bottom', 'left', 'right'])
        grid = empty_state.grid
        if edge == 'top':
            x = 1
            y = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[1] - 1)
        elif edge == 'bottom':
            x = grid.shape[0] - 2
            y = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[1] - 1)
        elif edge == 'left':
            x = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[0] - 1)
            y = 1
        elif edge == 'right':
            x = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[0] - 1)
            y = grid.shape[1] - 2
    else:
        # Place the goal anywhere in the grid
        x, y = random_position(empty_state.grid)

    goal_pos = (x, y)
    empty_state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Place the agent in a random empty cell inside the grid
    agent_pos = random_position(empty_state.grid)
    agent_dir = random_direction()

    # Ensure the agent position is not on the goal
    while agent_pos == goal_pos:
        agent_pos = random_position(empty_state.grid)

    return MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Grid Reference**:
   - In the section where the goal is placed near the edges, I added `grid = empty_state.grid` to ensure that `grid` is properly defined.

2. **Edge Placement**:
   - The logic for placing the goal near the edges remains the same, but now it correctly references `empty_state.grid`.

This should resolve the `NameError` and ensure that the function runs correctly, matching the observed distribution of initial states.
