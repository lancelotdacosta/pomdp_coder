To better model the true distribution of initial states, I need to ensure that the agent and the goal are placed in a way that matches the observed samples. Specifically, I notice that the goal is often placed near the edge of the grid, and the agent can be placed in various positions, including near the goal.

Here's an improved version of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    def random_position(grid):
        while True:
            x = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[0] - 1)
            y = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[1] - 1)
            if grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
                return (x, y)

    def random_direction():
        return np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # Place the goal in a random empty cell inside the grid, biased towards the edges
    goal_bias = 0.7  # Higher probability of placing the goal near the edges
    if np.random.rand() < goal_bias:
        # Place the goal near the edges
        edge = np.random.choice(['top', 'bottom', 'left', 'right'])
        if edge == 'top':
            x = 1
            y = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[1] - 1)
        elif edge == 'bottom':
            x = grid.shape[0] - 2
            y = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[1] - 1)
        elif edge == 'left':
            x = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[0] - 1)
            y = 1
        elif edge == 'right':
            x = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[0] - 1)
            y = grid.shape[1] - 2
    else:
        # Place the goal anywhere in the grid
        x, y = random_position(empty_state.grid)

    goal_pos = (x, y)
    empty_state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Place the agent in a random empty cell inside the grid
    agent_pos = random_position(empty_state.grid)
    agent_dir = random_direction()

    # Ensure the agent position is not on the goal
    while agent_pos == goal_pos:
        agent_pos = random_position(empty_state.grid)

    return MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
```

### Explanation

1. **Goal Placement**:
   - The goal is placed with a higher probability near the edges of the grid. This is achieved by introducing a bias factor (`goal_bias`), which is set to 0.7 in this case.
   - If the random number generated is less than `goal_bias`, the goal is placed near one of the edges (top, bottom, left, or right).
   - Otherwise, the goal is placed at a random position within the grid.

2. **Agent Placement**:
   - The agent is placed in a random empty cell within the grid.
   - A check is performed to ensure that the agent is not placed on the same cell as the goal.

This approach should better match the observed distribution of initial states, as it accounts for the higher frequency of goals being placed near the edges.
