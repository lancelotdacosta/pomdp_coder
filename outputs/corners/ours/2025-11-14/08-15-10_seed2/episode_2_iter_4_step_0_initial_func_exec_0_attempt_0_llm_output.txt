Based on the provided samples, it appears that the initial state distribution has the following characteristics:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent can be placed at various positions within the grid, typically avoiding the walls and sometimes near specific objects like the goal.
2. **Agent Direction**: The agent's initial direction is most commonly facing left (direction 2), but can also face down (direction 1).
3. **Grid Structure**: The grid is a 10x10 grid with walls around the perimeter and some internal structures. The only special object in the grid is a goal (object type 10), which is usually positioned in the bottom row.

Given these observations, we can model the initial state distribution by randomly placing the agent within the grid, ensuring it does not overlap with walls or other objects. We will also randomly set the agent's direction, with a higher probability of facing left.

Here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Ensure the grid is a 10x10 grid with walls around the perimeter
    assert empty_state.grid.shape == (10, 10)
    
    # Possible agent directions with higher probability for facing left
    directions = [2] * 70 + [1] * 30  # 70% chance of facing left, 30% chance of facing down
    
    # Randomly choose an agent direction
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(directions)
    
    # List of possible positions for the agent, avoiding walls and the goal
    possible_positions = []
    for x in range(1, 9):
        for y in range(1, 9):
            if empty_state.grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
                possible_positions.append((x, y))
    
    # Randomly choose an agent position
    agent_pos = np.random.choice(possible_positions)
    
    # Place the agent in the chosen position
    new_grid = empty_state.grid.copy()
    
    # Ensure the agent does not overlap with any objects
    assert new_grid[agent_pos[0], agent_pos[1]] == ObjectTypes.empty
    new_grid[agent_pos[0], agent_pos[1]] = ObjectTypes.agent
    
    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=new_grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
    
    return initial_state
```

This function ensures that the agent is placed in an empty cell within the grid, avoiding walls and other objects. The agent's direction is chosen randomly with a higher probability of facing left. The resulting `initial_state` is returned as a `MinigridState` object.
