Based on the provided samples from the real world, it seems that the distribution of initial states has the following characteristics:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent can start at any non-wall, non-goal position within the grid.
2. **Agent Direction**: The agent's initial direction is randomly chosen.
3. **Goal Position**: The goal is always placed at a non-wall, non-agent position within the grid.

The current implementation of `initial_func` is generally correct but might be generating positions for the agent and goal that are less diverse or more concentrated in certain areas compared to the real-world samples. To better match the true distribution, we need to ensure that the positions are uniformly distributed across the grid while avoiding wall and goal overlap.

Here is an improved version of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    
    def random_position(grid):
        """Generate a random position that is not a wall and not a goal."""
        while True:
            x = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[0] - 1)
            y = np.random.randint(1, grid.shape[1] - 1)
            if grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
                return (x, y)

    def random_direction():
        """Generate a random direction for the agent."""
        return np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # Generate a random position for the goal
    goal_pos = random_position(empty_state.grid)
    empty_state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Generate a random position for the agent that is not the same as the goal position
    agent_pos = random_position(empty_state.grid)
    while agent_pos == goal_pos:
        agent_pos = random_position(empty_state.grid)

    # Generate a random direction for the agent
    agent_dir = random_direction()

    # Return the initial state
    return MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
```

### Explanation of Improvements:
1. **Goal Position**: The goal position is generated first to ensure it is placed before the agent position, reducing the chance of overlap.
2. **Agent Position**: The agent position is generated after the goal position to avoid overlapping with the goal. The check `while agent_pos == goal_pos` ensures that the agent and goal are not in the same position.
3. **Uniform Distribution**: The `random_position` function ensures that both the agent and goal are placed uniformly across the non-wall, non-goal positions in the grid.

This should better match the distribution observed in the real-world samples.
