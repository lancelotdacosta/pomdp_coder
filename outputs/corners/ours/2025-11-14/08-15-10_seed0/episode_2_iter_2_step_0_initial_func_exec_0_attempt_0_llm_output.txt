Based on the provided samples from the real world, it appears that the goal object is consistently placed at the second-to-last row and the second-to-last column (i.e., `(height - 2, width - 2)`). The agent can be placed anywhere in the grid except for the walls and the goal object. The agent's direction is chosen randomly.

To improve the model, we need to ensure that the agent is placed in valid positions and that the goal object is always placed at the correct position. Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    grid = empty_state.grid.copy()
    width, height = grid.shape

    # Place the goal object at the second-to-last row and column
    grid[height - 2, width - 2] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Find all valid positions for the agent (excluding walls and goal)
    valid_positions = [
        (x, y) for x in range(1, width - 1) for y in range(1, height - 1) if grid[y, x] == ObjectTypes.empty
    ]

    # Randomly choose a valid position for the agent
    agent_pos = valid_positions[np.random.randint(len(valid_positions))]

    # Randomly choose the agent's direction
    agent_dir = np.random.choice([0, 1, 2, 3])

    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return initial_state
```

### Explanation:
1. **Goal Placement**: The goal object is always placed at the second-to-last row and column (`(height - 2, width - 2)`).
2. **Valid Agent Positions**: We generate a list of valid positions for the agent by iterating over all possible positions in the grid, excluding the walls and the goal position.
3. **Random Agent Position and Direction**: We randomly select one of the valid positions for the agent and randomly choose one of the four possible directions for the agent.
4. **Initial State Creation**: We create the initial state with the updated grid, agent position, agent direction, and no carried objects.

This should better match the distribution of initial states observed in the real world.
