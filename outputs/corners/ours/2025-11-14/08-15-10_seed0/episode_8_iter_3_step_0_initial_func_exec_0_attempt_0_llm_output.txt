Based on the provided samples, it seems that the goal is always placed at a fixed position (8, 8) and the agent can start at any valid empty position within the grid, except for the goal position. The agent's direction is randomly chosen, and there are no other objects present in the grid besides the walls, the goal, and the agent.

To better model this distribution, we need to ensure that the agent can be placed in any valid empty position, including positions where the agent is directly adjacent to the goal or any other valid empty cells. The current implementation already does this correctly, but let's refine it to ensure it matches the observed distribution more closely.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define the goal position (fixed in all samples)
    goal_pos = (8, 8)

    # Place the goal object in the grid
    empty_state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Randomly select a valid position for the agent
    valid_positions = [
        (x, y)
        for x in range(1, empty_state.width - 1)
        for y in range(1, empty_state.height - 1)
        if empty_state.grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty
    ]
    agent_pos = valid_positions[np.random.choice(len(valid_positions))]

    # Randomly select a direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.choice([0, 1, 2, 3])

    # Create the initial state with the agent's position and direction
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return initial_state
```

This function ensures that:
1. The goal is always placed at (8, 8).
2. The agent can be placed in any valid empty position within the grid, including positions adjacent to the goal.
3. The agent's direction is randomly chosen from the four possible directions.

The provided samples match this distribution, and the function should generate initial states that are consistent with the observed distribution.
