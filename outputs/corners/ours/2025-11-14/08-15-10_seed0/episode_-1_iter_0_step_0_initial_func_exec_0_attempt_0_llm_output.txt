Based on the provided samples, it appears that the distribution of initial states is characterized by:

1. The agent's position (`agent_pos`) can vary within an open area of the grid, but it seems to favor positions that are not too close to the walls and not at the bottom row.
2. The agent's direction (`agent_dir`) is uniformly distributed among the four possible directions (0: right, 1: down, 2: left, 3: up).
3. The agent is not carrying any object (`carrying=None`).
4. The grid layout is consistent across samples, with a goal object (represented by `10`) typically placed in various positions, often near the bottom of the grid.

Given this understanding, the `initial_func` function can be implemented as follows:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define the grid dimensions
    width = empty_state.width
    height = empty_state.height

    # Initialize the grid with empty cells (1) and walls (2)
    grid = empty_state.grid.copy()

    # Place the goal object in a random position near the bottom of the grid
    goal_row = np.random.choice(range(height - 2, height))
    goal_col = np.random.choice(range(1, width - 1))
    grid[goal_row, goal_col] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Sample a valid position for the agent that is not on the wall or the goal
    while True:
        agent_row = np.random.choice(range(1, height - 1))
        agent_col = np.random.choice(range(1, width - 1))
        if grid[agent_row, agent_col] == ObjectTypes.empty:
            break

    # Sample a random direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=(agent_col, agent_row),
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return initial_state
```

This function initializes the grid with walls and places a goal object near the bottom of the grid. It then samples a valid position for the agent that is not on a wall or the goal object and assigns a random direction to the agent. The resulting `MinigridState` is returned as the initial state of the environment.
