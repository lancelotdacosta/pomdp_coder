Based on the provided samples from the real world, it seems that the distribution of initial states has the following characteristics:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent can appear in any valid position within the grid, excluding the walls and the goal position.
2. **Agent Direction**: The agent's direction is uniformly random.
3. **Goal Position**: The goal can appear in any valid position within the grid, excluding the walls and the agent position.

The current model places the goal near the bottom of the grid, which does not match the observed distribution where the goal can appear anywhere. Additionally, the agent's position should be sampled independently of the goal's position to ensure they do not overlap.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function to better model the true distribution:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define the grid dimensions
    width = empty_state.width
    height = empty_state.height

    # Initialize the grid with empty cells (1) and walls (2)
    grid = empty_state.grid.copy()

    # Sample a valid position for the agent that is not on the wall
    while True:
        agent_row = np.random.choice(range(1, height - 1))
        agent_col = np.random.choice(range(1, width - 1))
        if grid[agent_row, agent_col] == ObjectTypes.empty:
            break

    # Sample a random direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # Place the goal object in a random position near the bottom of the grid, excluding the agent's position
    while True:
        goal_row = np.random.choice(range(1, height - 1))
        goal_col = np.random.choice(range(1, width - 1))
        if (goal_row, goal_col) != (agent_row, agent_col) and grid[goal_row, goal_col] == ObjectTypes.empty:
            grid[goal_row, goal_col] = ObjectTypes.goal
            break

    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=(agent_col, agent_row),
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return initial_state
```

This function ensures that both the agent and the goal are placed in valid positions within the grid, and they do not overlap. The agent's position and direction are sampled independently, and the goal can appear anywhere in the grid except on the walls or the agent's position. This should better match the observed distribution of initial states.
