Based on the provided samples, it appears that the initial state distribution is characterized by:

1. The agent can start at any valid position within the grid, excluding the walls.
2. The agent's direction (facing right, down, left, up) is uniformly distributed.
3. The grid is mostly empty, with the exception of walls around the perimeter and a goal object (`ObjectTypes.goal`) located at the bottom-right corner of the grid.

Given this understanding, the `initial_func` function will:

1. Ensure the grid is correctly initialized with walls.
2. Randomly place the agent in a valid empty cell.
3. Randomly set the agent's direction.
4. Ensure the goal object is placed in the bottom-right corner of the grid.

Here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    grid = empty_state.grid.copy()
    width, height = grid.shape

    # Place the goal object at the bottom-right corner
    grid[height - 2, width - 2] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Randomly choose a valid position for the agent
    while True:
        x = np.random.randint(1, width - 1)
        y = np.random.randint(1, height - 1)
        if grid[y, x] == ObjectTypes.empty:
            break

    # Randomly choose the agent's direction
    agent_dir = np.random.choice([0, 1, 2, 3])

    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=(x, y),
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return initial_state
```

This function initializes the grid with the goal object in the bottom-right corner and places the agent in a random empty cell within the grid. The agent's direction is also randomly chosen from the four possible directions.
