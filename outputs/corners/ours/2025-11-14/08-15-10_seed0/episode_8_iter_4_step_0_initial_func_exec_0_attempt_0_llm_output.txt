Based on the provided samples, it seems that the goal position is fixed at (8, 8) in all cases, and the agent can be placed at any valid position within the grid, including positions adjacent to the goal. The agent's direction is also random.

To improve the model, we need to ensure that the agent's position is sampled uniformly from all valid positions, including those adjacent to the goal. Additionally, we should ensure that the agent can face any of the four directions with equal probability.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define the goal position (fixed in all samples)
    goal_pos = (8, 8)

    # Place the goal object in the grid
    empty_state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Randomly select a valid position for the agent
    valid_positions = [
        (x, y)
        for x in range(1, empty_state.width - 1)
        for y in range(1, empty_state.height - 1)
        if empty_state.grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty
    ]
    agent_pos = valid_positions[np.random.choice(len(valid_positions))]

    # Randomly select a direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.choice([0, 1, 2, 3])

    # Create the initial state with the agent's position and direction
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),  # Ensure we don't modify the original empty_state
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return initial_state
```

### Explanation:
1. **Goal Position**: The goal is always placed at (8, 8) in the grid.
2. **Agent Position**: We generate a list of all valid positions within the grid that are not walls and not already occupied by the goal. We then randomly choose one of these positions for the agent.
3. **Agent Direction**: The agent's direction is chosen randomly from the four possible directions (0: right, 1: down, 2: left, 3: up).
4. **Copy Grid**: To ensure that we don't modify the original `empty_state`, we create a copy of the grid when initializing the `initial_state`.

This should better model the true distribution of initial states based on the provided samples.
