### Explanation of the Distribution of Initial States:

1. **Grid Structure**: The grid is a 10x10 grid with walls around the perimeter (all cells on the edges are walls). The interior of the grid contains either empty cells or a goal object.

2. **Agent Position**: The agent can start in any open cell (i.e., a cell that is not a wall). The position is chosen randomly from the available open cells.

3. **Agent Direction**: The agent's initial direction is randomly chosen from the four possible directions: right (0), down (1), left (2), and up (3).

4. **Goal Object**: A goal object is placed in one of the remaining open cells, if any are available. The goal object's position is also chosen randomly from the remaining open cells.

This distribution ensures that the initial state is varied and does not overfit to the specific samples provided. Each time `initial_func` is called, it will generate a new initial state by randomly placing the agent and the goal within the constraints of the grid.
