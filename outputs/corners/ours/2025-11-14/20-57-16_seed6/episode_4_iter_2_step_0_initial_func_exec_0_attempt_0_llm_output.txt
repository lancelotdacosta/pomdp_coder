The distribution of initial states suggests that the agent can start at various positions within the grid, with different orientations. The grid itself is mostly empty except for walls around the boundary and a goal object (10) located somewhere in the grid.

Based on the provided samples, here’s a summary of the observed initial state distribution:
- The agent's position can be at multiple locations within the grid, typically avoiding the walls.
- The agent's direction can be one of four possible values: 0 (facing right), 1 (facing down), 2 (facing left), 3 (facing up).
- The grid is a 10x10 grid with walls (2) around the boundary and a goal object (10) located at various positions.
- The agent is not carrying any object initially.

To model this distribution, we will:
1. Randomly select an initial position for the agent that is not a wall.
2. Randomly select an initial direction for the agent.
3. Place a goal object at a random location within the grid, avoiding the walls and the agent's initial position.

Here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    grid = empty_state.grid.copy()
    width, height = grid.shape

    # Ensure the goal position is not a wall and not the same as the agent's position
    def get_random_goal_position():
        while True:
            x, y = np.random.randint(1, width - 1), np.random.randint(1, height - 1)
            if grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
                return (x, y)

    # Ensure the agent's initial position is not a wall and not the same as the goal position
    def get_random_agent_position(goal_pos):
        while True:
            x, y = np.random.randint(1, width - 1), np.random.randint(1, height - 1)
            if grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty and (x, y) != goal_pos:
                return (x, y)

    # Place the goal object at a random position
    goal_pos = get_random_goal_position()
    grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Set the agent's initial position
    agent_pos = get_random_agent_position(goal_pos)

    # Set the agent's initial direction
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return initial_state
```

This function ensures that the agent starts at a valid position within the grid, with a random direction, and places the goal object at another valid position. The grid is otherwise empty except for the walls around the boundary.
