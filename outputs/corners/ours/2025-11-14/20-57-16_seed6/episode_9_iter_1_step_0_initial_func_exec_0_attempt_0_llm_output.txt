Based on the provided samples from the real world, I can infer the following distribution of initial states:

1. **Agent and Goal Placement**:
   - Both the agent and the goal are placed within the inner part of the grid (excluding the outer walls).
   - The agent and the goal do not overlap (they are placed at different positions).

2. **Agent Direction**:
   - The agent's direction is uniformly random (0, 1, 2, or 3).

3. **Grid Structure**:
   - The grid has a fixed size with walls around the perimeter.
   - The inner part of the grid is initially empty (ObjectTypes.empty).

Given this understanding, the initial function should be adjusted to ensure that the agent and the goal are placed in valid positions and that their positions do not overlap. Additionally, the agent's direction should be randomized.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define the grid size
    grid_size = empty_state.grid.shape[0]

    # Sample a random position for the agent within the inner part of the grid
    while True:
        agent_x = np.random.randint(1, grid_size - 1)
        agent_y = np.random.randint(1, grid_size - 1)
        if empty_state.grid[agent_x, agent_y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
            break

    # Sample a random direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # Sample a random position for the goal object
    while True:
        goal_x = np.random.randint(1, grid_size - 1)
        goal_y = np.random.randint(1, grid_size - 1)
        if empty_state.grid[goal_x, goal_y] == ObjectTypes.empty and (goal_x, goal_y) != (agent_x, agent_y):
            break

    # Place the goal object in the grid
    empty_state.grid[goal_x, goal_y] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),
        agent_pos=(agent_x, agent_y),
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return initial_state
```

This function ensures that:
- The agent is placed at a valid empty position within the inner part of the grid.
- The goal is placed at a different valid empty position within the inner part of the grid.
- The agent's direction is randomly chosen from the four possible directions.
