Based on the provided samples from the real world, it seems that the distribution of initial states allows for more flexibility in terms of where the goal object can be placed. The goal object can appear at various positions within the inner grid, and the agent's initial position is also flexible, as long as it does not overlap with the goal object.

To better model this distribution, we need to ensure that the goal object can be placed at any valid position within the inner grid (1, 1) to (8, 8). Additionally, the agent's initial position should be sampled from the remaining valid positions, ensuring it does not overlap with the goal object. The agent's direction can be randomly chosen from the four possible directions.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

This updated `initial_func` function ensures that the goal object and the agent can be placed at any valid position within the inner grid, and it avoids overlap between the goal and the agent. This should better model the true distribution of initial states.
