To better model the true distribution of initial states, we need to ensure that the agent and the goal are placed in a way that matches the real-world samples. The real-world samples show that the agent and the goal can appear in various positions within the grid, and they do not always avoid each other. We should allow for more flexibility in placing the agent and the goal while ensuring they do not overlap.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Create a copy of the empty state to avoid modifying the original
    state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),
        agent_pos=(0, 0),
        agent_dir=0,
        carrying=None
    )

    # Define the valid positions for the agent and the goal
    valid_positions = [
        (x, y) for x in range(1, 9) for y in range(1, 9)
    ]

    # Place the agent at a random position within the valid positions
    agent_pos_index = np.random.choice(len(valid_positions))
    agent_pos = valid_positions[agent_pos_index]
    state.agent_pos = agent_pos

    # Set the agent's direction randomly
    state.agent_dir = np.random.randint(4)

    # Remove the agent's position from the list of valid positions
    valid_positions.remove(agent_pos)

    # Place the goal object at a random position within the remaining valid positions
    goal_pos_index = np.random.choice(len(valid_positions))
    goal_pos = valid_positions[goal_pos_index]
    state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    return state
```

### Explanation:
1. **Valid Positions**: We define the valid positions for both the agent and the goal as all positions inside the grid, excluding the walls (i.e., positions from (1, 1) to (8, 8)).
2. **Agent Placement**: The agent is placed at a random position within the valid positions.
3. **Agent Direction**: The agent's direction is set randomly.
4. **Goal Placement**: The agent's position is removed from the list of valid positions to ensure the goal does not overlap with the agent. The goal is then placed at a random position from the remaining valid positions.

This approach ensures that the agent and the goal can appear in various positions within the grid, matching the real-world samples more closely.
