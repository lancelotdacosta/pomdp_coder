The distribution of initial states in the environment seems to follow these patterns:

1. The agent's position and direction are variable, but they tend to be within the open spaces of the grid.
2. There is one special object (represented by `10`) that appears at a fixed location in the bottom row, towards the right side of the grid.
3. The grid itself is consistent in its wall structure, with walls surrounding the outer perimeter and an open interior.

Based on these observations, we can model the initial state distribution by placing the agent in random valid positions within the grid, assigning a random direction, and ensuring the special object (`10`) is placed in its fixed position.

Here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    
    # Ensure the special object (10) is placed in the fixed position
    special_object_pos = (8, 8)
    empty_state.grid[special_object_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal
    
    # Define valid positions for the agent
    valid_positions = [
        (x, y)
        for x in range(1, empty_state.width - 1)
        for y in range(1, empty_state.height - 1)
        if empty_state.grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty
    ]
    
    # Randomly select a valid position for the agent
    agent_pos = np.random.choice(valid_positions)
    
    # Randomly select a direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.randint(0, 4)
    
    # Ensure the agent is not placed on the special object
    while agent_pos == special_object_pos:
        agent_pos = np.random.choice(valid_positions)
    
    # Create the initial state with the chosen agent position and direction
    state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
    
    return state
```

This function ensures that the special object is always placed in its fixed position, the agent is placed in a random valid position within the grid, and the agent's direction is randomly assigned. The function also ensures that the agent is not placed on the special object.
