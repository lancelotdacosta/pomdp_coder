Based on the provided samples from the real world and your model, it seems that the distribution of initial states in the Minigrid environment has the following characteristics:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent can be placed at any valid position (i.e., not on walls) within the grid.
2. **Agent Direction**: The agent's direction is uniformly random.
3. **Goal Position**: The goal can be placed at any valid position (i.e., not on walls and not where the agent is already located) within the grid.

However, the issue with your current implementation is that it places the goal in a position that might not be as diverse as the real-world samples. The real-world samples show that the goal can be placed in various positions, including near the edges of the grid.

To improve the code, we need to ensure that the goal placement is more diverse and not limited to a specific range of positions. Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    grid = empty_state.grid.copy()
    width, height = grid.shape

    # Sample a random valid position for the agent
    valid_positions = [(x, y) for x in range(1, width - 1) for y in range(1, height - 1) if grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty]
    agent_pos = valid_positions[np.random.choice(len(valid_positions))]

    # Sample a random direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.choice([0, 1, 2, 3])

    # Ensure the goal is placed somewhere in the grid, but not on the agent's position
    valid_goal_positions = [(x, y) for x in range(1, width - 1) for y in range(1, height - 1) if grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty and (x, y) != agent_pos]
    goal_pos = valid_goal_positions[np.random.choice(len(valid_goal_positions))]
    grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return initial_state
```

### Explanation of Improvements:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent's position is sampled from all valid positions within the grid.
2. **Agent Direction**: The agent's direction is uniformly random.
3. **Goal Position**: The goal's position is sampled from all valid positions within the grid, ensuring it is not on the same position as the agent.

This should better model the true distribution of initial states in the Minigrid environment.
