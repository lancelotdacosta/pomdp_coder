Based on the provided samples from the real world, it seems that the agent and the goal can appear at various positions within the grid, but there are some patterns:

1. **Agent Placement**: The agent can be placed anywhere in the open cells ( cells with `ObjectTypes.empty`), and its direction is random.
2. **Goal Placement**: The goal can also be placed in any of the open cells, but it should not be placed at the same position as the agent.

To improve the `initial_func` function, we need to ensure that:
- The agent and goal are placed in different open cells.
- The placement is done in a way that reflects the observed distribution, which seems to allow for more flexibility in their positions.

Here's the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    grid = empty_state.grid.copy()
    width, height = grid.shape

    # Find all open cells (excluding walls)
    open_cells = [(x, y) for x in range(1, width-1) for y in range(1, height-1) if grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty]

    # Randomly place the goal cell
    goal_pos_idx = np.random.choice(len(open_cells))
    goal_x, goal_y = open_cells[goal_pos_idx]
    grid[goal_x, goal_y] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Remove the goal cell from the list of open cells
    del open_cells[goal_pos_idx]

    # Ensure the agent is placed in a different open cell
    agent_pos_idx = np.random.choice(len(open_cells))
    agent_x, agent_y = open_cells[agent_pos_idx]
    agent_dir = np.random.randint(0, 4)

    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=(agent_x, agent_y),
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return initial_state
```

This function ensures that the agent and the goal are placed in different open cells, which should better reflect the observed distribution of initial states.
