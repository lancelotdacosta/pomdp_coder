The error you're encountering is due to the way `numpy` arrays are being handled when selecting a random index. Specifically, when using `np.random.choice`, it returns an integer index, which is then used to index into a `numpy` array. However, the result of this indexing operation is a single integer, not an iterable.

To fix this, you need to ensure that the selected index is used correctly to extract the position from the `remaining_empty_cells` array. Here's the corrected version of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Copy the grid to avoid modifying the original
    grid = np.copy(empty_state.grid)

    # Find all empty cells (non-wall cells)
    empty_cells = np.column_stack(np.where(grid == ObjectTypes.empty))

    # Randomly choose an empty cell for the agent's initial position
    agent_pos_idx = np.random.choice(len(empty_cells))
    agent_pos = tuple(empty_cells[agent_pos_idx])

    # Randomly choose an initial direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.randint(4)

    # Set the agent's position in the grid
    grid[agent_pos] = ObjectTypes.agent

    # Remove the agent's position from the list of empty cells
    remaining_empty_cells = np.delete(empty_cells, agent_pos_idx, axis=0)

    # Randomly place a goal object in one of the remaining empty cells
    goal_pos_idx = np.random.choice(len(remaining_empty_cells))
    goal_pos = tuple(remaining_empty_cells[goal_pos_idx])
    grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Create and return the initial state
    state = MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return state
```

### Explanation:
1. **Agent Position Selection**:
   - `empty_cells` is a 2D array where each row represents an empty cell's coordinates.
   - `agent_pos_idx` is a random index selected from the range of `len(empty_cells)`.
   - `agent_pos` is then obtained by indexing into `empty_cells` using `agent_pos_idx` and converting it to a tuple.

2. **Removing Agent Position from Empty Cells**:
   - `np.delete` is used to remove the agent's position from the list of empty cells to avoid placing the goal at the same position as the agent.

3. **Goal Position Selection**:
   - `goal_pos_idx` is a random index selected from the remaining empty cells.
   - `goal_pos` is obtained by indexing into `remaining_empty_cells` using `goal_pos_idx` and converting it to a tuple.

4. **Setting the Grid**:
   - The agent's position and the goal's position are set in the grid.

This should resolve the `TypeError` you encountered and correctly initialize the environment state.
