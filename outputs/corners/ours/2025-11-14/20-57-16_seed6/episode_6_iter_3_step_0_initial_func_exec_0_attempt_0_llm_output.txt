Based on the provided samples, it seems that the distribution of initial states has the following characteristics:

1. **Grid Size and Structure**: The grid is always 10x10, with walls along the edges, and the inner 8x8 grid is initially empty except for the goal object.
2. **Goal Object**: The goal object (ObjectTypes.goal) is placed at a random position within the inner 8x8 grid.
3. **Agent Position**: The agent can be placed at any position within the inner 8x8 grid, but not on the same position as the goal object.
4. **Agent Direction**: The agent's initial direction is chosen randomly from the four possible directions (facing right, down, left, or up).
5. **Carrying**: The agent does not carry any object initially.

The main issue with the previous code is that it might not be placing the goal object and the agent in all possible valid positions within the inner 8x8 grid. To improve the model, we need to ensure that the goal object and the agent are placed uniformly across all valid positions.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Ensure the grid has the correct size and structure
    assert empty_state.grid.shape == (10, 10), "Grid must be 10x10"
    assert np.all(empty_state.grid[:, [0, -1]] == ObjectTypes.wall), "Walls must be on the edges"
    assert np.all(empty_state.grid[[0, -1], :] == ObjectTypes.wall), "Walls must be on the edges"
    assert np.all(empty_state.grid[1:-1, 1:-1] == ObjectTypes.empty), "Inner grid must be empty"

    # Place the goal object at a random position in the inner grid
    goal_pos = (np.random.randint(1, 9), np.random.randint(1, 9))
    empty_state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Sample the agent's initial position
    valid_positions = [(x, y) for x in range(1, 9) for y in range(1, 9) if (x, y) != goal_pos]
    agent_pos = valid_positions[np.random.choice(len(valid_positions))]

    # Sample the agent's initial direction
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # The agent does not carry any object initially
    carrying = None

    # Return the initial state with the sampled values
    return MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),  # Ensure we do not modify the original grid
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=carrying
    )
```

This function ensures that:
- The goal object is placed at a random position within the inner 8x8 grid.
- The agent is placed at a random position within the inner 8x8 grid, but not on the same position as the goal object.
- The agent's direction is chosen randomly from the four possible directions.
- The agent does not carry any object initially.

By ensuring uniform placement of the goal and the agent, this function should better model the true distribution of initial states.
