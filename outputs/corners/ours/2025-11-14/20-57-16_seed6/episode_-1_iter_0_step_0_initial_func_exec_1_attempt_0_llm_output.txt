The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `np.random.choice` expects a 1-dimensional array, but `valid_positions` is a list of tuples. To resolve this, we need to convert `valid_positions` into a 1-dimensional array and then use `np.random.randint` to select an index from this array.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    
    # Ensure the special object (10) is placed in the fixed position
    special_object_pos = (8, 8)
    empty_state.grid[special_object_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal
    
    # Define valid positions for the agent
    valid_positions = [
        (x, y)
        for x in range(1, empty_state.width - 1)
        for y in range(1, empty_state.height - 1)
        if empty_state.grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty
    ]
    
    # Randomly select a valid position for the agent
    if valid_positions:
        idx = np.random.randint(0, len(valid_positions))
        agent_pos = valid_positions[idx]
    else:
        raise ValueError("No valid positions available for the agent")
    
    # Randomly select a direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.randint(0, 4)
    
    # Ensure the agent is not placed on the special object
    while agent_pos == special_object_pos:
        idx = np.random.randint(0, len(valid_positions))
        agent_pos = valid_positions[idx]
    
    # Create the initial state with the chosen agent position and direction
    state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
    
    return state
```

In this implementation:
1. We use `np.random.randint` to select an index from the list of valid positions.
2. We then use this index to get the agent's position from the list.
3. We ensure that the agent is not placed on the special object by reselecting a valid position if necessary.

This should resolve the `ValueError` you were encountering.
