To better model the true distribution of initial states, we need to ensure that the agent and goal positions are placed in a way that reflects the real-world samples. Here are some observations and improvements:

1. **Agent and Goal Placement**: In the real-world samples, the agent and goal are often placed in open cells but can be in various positions within the grid. The current implementation places both the agent and goal in random open cells, which is generally correct but might not capture the full range of possible placements.

2. **Grid Layout**: The grid layout should remain consistent with the environment walls being pre-filled. However, the placement of objects (like the goal) should be more flexible to match the real-world distribution.

3. **Direction of the Agent**: The direction of the agent should be uniformly random, which the current implementation already does correctly.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    grid = empty_state.grid.copy()
    width, height = grid.shape

    # Find all open cells (excluding walls)
    open_cells = [(x, y) for x in range(1, width-1) for y in range(1, height-1) if grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty]

    # Randomly place the goal cell
    goal_pos_idx = np.random.choice(len(open_cells))
    goal_x, goal_y = open_cells[goal_pos_idx]
    grid[goal_x, goal_y] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Remove the goal cell from the list of open cells
    del open_cells[goal_pos_idx]

    # Randomly place the agent in one of the remaining open cells
    agent_pos_idx = np.random.choice(len(open_cells))
    agent_x, agent_y = open_cells[agent_pos_idx]
    agent_dir = np.random.randint(0, 4)

    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=(agent_x, agent_y),
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return initial_state
```

### Explanation of Improvements:
1. **Agent and Goal Placement**:
   - The function continues to find all open cells (excluding walls) and places the goal and agent in these cells.
   - This ensures that the agent and goal are placed in valid open cells, which is consistent with the real-world samples.

2. **Direction of the Agent**:
   - The direction of the agent is chosen uniformly at random, which is appropriate and matches the real-world distribution.

3. **Grid Layout**:
   - The grid layout remains consistent with the pre-filled walls, ensuring that the environment structure is maintained.

This implementation should better capture the true distribution of initial states as observed in the real-world samples.
