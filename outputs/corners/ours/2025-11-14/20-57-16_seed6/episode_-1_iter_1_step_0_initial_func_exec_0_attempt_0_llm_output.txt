To better model the true distribution of initial states, let's analyze the provided samples from the real world and identify the key characteristics:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent can be placed at various positions within the grid, but it should not be on the special object (goal) or on the walls.
2. **Agent Direction**: The agent can face in any direction (0, 1, 2, 3).
3. **Special Object Position**: The special object (goal) is placed at a fixed position (8, 8).

Based on this analysis, we need to ensure that the agent is placed randomly within the valid positions, avoiding the special object and the walls. We also need to ensure the agent can face any direction.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    
    # Ensure the special object (10) is placed in the fixed position
    special_object_pos = (8, 8)
    empty_state.grid[special_object_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal
    
    # Define valid positions for the agent
    valid_positions = [
        (x, y)
        for x in range(1, empty_state.width - 1)
        for y in range(1, empty_state.height - 1)
        if empty_state.grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty
    ]
    
    # Randomly select a valid position for the agent
    if valid_positions:
        idx = np.random.randint(0, len(valid_positions))
        agent_pos = valid_positions[idx]
    else:
        raise ValueError("No valid positions available for the agent")
    
    # Randomly select a direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.randint(0, 4)
    
    # Ensure the agent is not placed on the special object
    while agent_pos == special_object_pos:
        idx = np.random.randint(0, len(valid_positions))
        agent_pos = valid_positions[idx]
    
    # Create the initial state with the chosen agent position and direction
    state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
    
    return state
```

### Explanation:

1. **Special Object Placement**: The special object (goal) is always placed at the fixed position (8, 8).
2. **Valid Positions for Agent**: We generate a list of valid positions for the agent, ensuring it does not overlap with walls or the special object.
3. **Random Agent Position and Direction**: We randomly select a valid position and direction for the agent. If the selected position coincides with the special object, we reselect until a valid position is found.
4. **State Creation**: We create and return the initial state with the chosen agent position, direction, and the grid with the special object placed.

This approach ensures that the generated initial states are more consistent with the true distribution observed in the real world.
