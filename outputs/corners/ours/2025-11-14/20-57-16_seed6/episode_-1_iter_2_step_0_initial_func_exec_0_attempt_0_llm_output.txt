To improve the `initial_func` function to better match the observed distribution, we need to ensure that the agent's position and direction are more representative of the real-world samples. Specifically, we should:

1. Ensure that the agent can be placed in a wider range of positions within the grid.
2. Ensure that the agent's direction is uniformly distributed.
3. Ensure that the agent is never placed on the special object (goal).

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    
    # Ensure the special object (10) is placed in a fixed position
    special_object_pos = (8, 8)
    empty_state.grid[special_object_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal
    
    # Define valid positions for the agent
    valid_positions = [
        (x, y)
        for x in range(1, empty_state.width - 1)
        for y in range(1, empty_state.height - 1)
        if empty_state.grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty
    ]
    
    # Randomly select a valid position for the agent
    if valid_positions:
        idx = np.random.randint(0, len(valid_positions))
        agent_pos = valid_positions[idx]
    else:
        raise ValueError("No valid positions available for the agent")
    
    # Randomly select a direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.randint(0, 4)
    
    # Ensure the agent is not placed on the special object
    while agent_pos == special_object_pos:
        idx = np.random.randint(0, len(valid_positions))
        agent_pos = valid_positions[idx]
    
    # Create the initial state with the chosen agent position and direction
    state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
    
    return state
```

### Explanation of the Distribution

1. **Agent Position**:
   - The agent can be placed in any empty cell within the grid, excluding the walls and the special object (goal) at position (8, 8).
   - This ensures that the agent can start from any valid position, which matches the observed distribution.

2. **Agent Direction**:
   - The agent's direction is uniformly distributed, meaning it can face any of the four directions (right, down, left, up) with equal probability.
   - This matches the observed distribution where the agent can start facing any direction.

3. **Special Object (Goal)**:
   - The special object (goal) is always placed at a fixed position (8, 8), and the agent is never placed on this cell.
   - This ensures that the special object is consistently located and the agent does not start on it, which matches the observed distribution.

By ensuring these conditions, the `initial_func` function should generate initial states that are more representative of the true distribution observed in the real world.
