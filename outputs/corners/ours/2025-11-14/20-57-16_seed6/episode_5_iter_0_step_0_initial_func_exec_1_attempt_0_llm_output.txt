The error you're encountering is due to the `np.random.choice` function expecting a 1-dimensional array, but you're providing it with a list of tuples. To fix this, you can directly select a goal position from the list of valid goal positions using Python's built-in `random.choice` instead of `np.random.choice`.

Here is the corrected implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
import random

def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    
    # Define the grid dimensions
    width = empty_state.width
    height = empty_state.height
    
    # Place the goal in the grid
    goal_positions = [(8, 8), (8, 9), (9, 8)]
    goal_pos = random.choice(goal_positions)
    empty_state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Define the valid positions for the agent (excluding walls and goal)
    valid_positions = []
    for x in range(1, width - 1):
        for y in range(1, height - 1):
            if (x, y) != goal_pos:
                valid_positions.append((x, y))
    
    # Randomly select the agent's initial position
    agent_pos = random.choice(valid_positions)
    
    # Randomly select the agent's initial direction
    agent_dir = random.choice(list(Direction))

    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return initial_state
```

In this corrected version, `random.choice` is used to select both the goal position and the agent's initial position. This should resolve the `ValueError: a must be 1-dimensional` issue and ensure that the function works as expected.
