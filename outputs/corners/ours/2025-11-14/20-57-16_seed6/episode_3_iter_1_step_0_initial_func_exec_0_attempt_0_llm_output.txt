Based on the provided samples, it appears that the distribution of initial states has the following characteristics:

1. **Goal Position**: The goal can be placed anywhere within the open cells (excluding walls).
2. **Agent Position**: The agent can be placed anywhere within the open cells (excluding walls), and it can be placed in any direction (0 to 3).
3. **Empty Cells**: All open cells are initially empty (ObjectTypes.empty) except for the goal and the agent positions.

The current implementation places the goal and the agent in random open cells, but it seems to place the goal and the agent too close to each other or in a way that does not match the observed distribution. To better model the true distribution, we should ensure that the goal and the agent are placed independently and randomly within the open cells, ensuring they do not overlap.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    grid = empty_state.grid.copy()
    width, height = grid.shape

    # Find all open cells (excluding walls)
    open_cells = [(x, y) for x in range(1, width-1) for y in range(1, height-1) if grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty]

    # Randomly place the goal cell
    goal_pos = np.random.choice(len(open_cells))
    goal_x, goal_y = open_cells[goal_pos]
    grid[goal_x, goal_y] = ObjectTypes.goal
    del open_cells[goal_pos]

    # Randomly place the agent in one of the remaining open cells
    agent_pos = np.random.choice(len(open_cells))
    agent_x, agent_y = open_cells[agent_pos]
    agent_dir = np.random.randint(0, 4)

    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=(agent_x, agent_y),
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return initial_state
```

This function ensures that the goal and the agent are placed independently and randomly within the open cells, which should better match the observed distribution. Theagent and goal positions are chosen from the list of open cells, ensuring they do not overlap with each other or with walls.
