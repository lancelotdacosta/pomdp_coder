The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `np.random.choice` expects a 1-dimensional array, but `possible_positions` is a list of tuples. To resolve this, we can use `np.random.choice` to select an index and then use that index to get the position tuple from `possible_positions`.

Here's the corrected `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define the possible positions for the agent within the interior of the grid
    possible_positions = [(x, y) for x in range(1, 9) for y in range(1, 9)]

    # Randomly select an agent position by index
    agent_pos_index = np.random.choice(len(possible_positions))
    agent_pos = possible_positions[agent_pos_index]
    
    # Randomly select an agent direction
    agent_dir = np.random.randint(0, 4)
    
    # Place the object (value 10) in a random position in the bottom row
    bottom_row_positions = [(x, 8) for x in range(1, 9)]
    object_pos_index = np.random.choice(len(bottom_row_positions))
    object_pos = bottom_row_positions[object_pos_index]
    empty_state.grid[object_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal
    
    # Ensure the selected agent position is not the same as the object position
    while agent_pos == object_pos:
        agent_pos_index = np.random.choice(len(possible_positions))
        agent_pos = possible_positions[agent_pos_index]
    
    # Create the initial state with the agent's position, direction, and the grid
    state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
    
    return state
```

In this implementation:
1. We generate a list of possible positions for the agent within the interior of the grid.
2. We use `np.random.choice` to select an index from the list of possible positions and then use that index to get the actual position tuple.
3. We randomly select an agent direction.
4. We place an object (value `10`) in a random position in the bottom row using the same method.
5. We ensure the selected agent position is not the same as the object position by reselecting the agent position if necessary.
6. We create and return the initial state with the agent's position, direction, and the grid.

This should resolve the `ValueError: a must be 1-dimensional` issue.
