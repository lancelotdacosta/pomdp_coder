Based on the provided samples, it appears that the distribution of initial states has the following characteristics:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent can start at various positions within the grid, but not on walls or the goal cell.
2. **Agent Direction**: The agent's initial direction is randomly selected from the four possible directions (0: right, 1: down, 2: left, 3: up).
3. **Grid Configuration**: The grid is mostly empty except for walls and a single goal cell (10) located somewhere in the grid.

Given these observations, the `initial_func` function will:
- Randomly select an initial position for the agent from all valid positions (excluding walls and the goal).
- Randomly select an initial direction for the agent.
- Ensure the grid is properly set up with the goal cell in a random location.

Here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    
    # Extract the grid from the empty state
    grid = empty_state.grid
    
    # Find all valid positions for the agent (excluding walls and the goal)
    valid_positions = [(x, y) for x in range(1, grid.shape[0] - 1) for y in range(1, grid.shape[1] - 1) if grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty]
    
    # Randomly select an initial position for the agent
    agent_pos = valid_positions[np.random.choice(len(valid_positions))]
    
    # Randomly select an initial direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))
    
    # Place the goal cell in a random empty position (excluding the selected agent position)
    goal_positions = [pos for pos in valid_positions if pos != agent_pos]
    goal_pos = goal_positions[np.random.choice(len(goal_positions))]
    grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal
    
    # Create and return the initial state
    state = MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
    
    return state
```

This function ensures that the initial state is generated by randomly placing the agent and the goal cell in valid positions within the grid. The agent's direction is also randomly chosen from the four possible directions.
