The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `np.random.choice` expects a 1-dimensional array, but you are passing a list of tuples. To resolve this, we need to ensure that the positions are selected correctly and that the choice function is used appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `initial_func`:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    grid = empty_state.grid.copy()
    
    # Define the possible positions for the goal and the agent
    possible_positions = [
        (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 8),
        (5, 3), (6, 2), (4, 4), (3, 8), (3, 3)
    ]
    
    # Randomly select a position for the goal
    goal_pos = possible_positions[np.random.choice(len(possible_positions))]
    grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal
    
    # Remove the goal position from the possible agent positions
    possible_agent_positions = [pos for pos in possible_positions if pos != goal_pos]
    
    # Randomly select a position for the agent
    agent_pos = possible_agent_positions[np.random.choice(len(possible_agent_positions))]
    
    # Randomly select a direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))
    
    return MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
```

### Explanation:
1. **Possible Positions**: We define the list of possible positions for both the goal and the agent.
2. **Select Goal Position**: We use `np.random.choice` to select an index from the list of possible positions. This index is then used to select the goal position.
3. **Remove Goal Position**: We create a new list of possible agent positions by excluding the chosen goal position.
4. **Select Agent Position**: Similarly, we use `np.random.choice` to select an index from the list of possible agent positions. This index is then used to select the agent position.
5. **Select Agent Direction**: We randomly choose a direction for the agent from the `Direction` enum.

This approach ensures that the `np.random.choice` function is used correctly with 1-dimensional arrays (or lists) and should resolve the error you encountered.
