Based on the provided samples, it seems that the distribution of initial states has the following characteristics:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent can be placed in any open cell (i.e., cells that are not walls) within the grid.
2. **Agent Direction**: The agent's initial direction is chosen randomly from the four possible directions (right, down, left, up).
3. **Goal Position**: The goal object is also placed in an open cell, but it must not be the same as the agent's position.

However, there are some subtle differences between the real-world samples and the generated samples from the previous code. Specifically, the real-world samples show that the goal object can be placed in various positions, including the bottom row of the grid, which was not consistently observed in the generated samples.

To improve the model, we need to ensure that the goal object is placed more uniformly across the open cells, especially considering the bottom row where it appears more frequently in the real-world samples.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Create a copy of the empty state to avoid modifying the original
    state = MinigridState(
        grid=np.copy(empty_state.grid),
        agent_pos=empty_state.agent_pos,
        agent_dir=empty_state.agent_dir,
        carrying=empty_state.carrying
    )

    # Get all positions within the grid that are not walls
    open_cells = np.where(state.grid == ObjectTypes.empty)
    open_cells = list(zip(open_cells[0], open_cells[1]))

    # Randomly select an open cell for the agent's initial position
    state.agent_pos = open_cells[np.random.randint(len(open_cells))]

    # Randomly select a direction for the agent
    state.agent_dir = np.random.randint(4)

    # Randomly place a goal object in an open cell, ensuring it is not the same as the agent's position
    goal_pos = open_cells[np.random.randint(len(open_cells))]
    while goal_pos == state.agent_pos:
        goal_pos = open_cells[np.random.randint(len(open_cells))]
    state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # The agent is not carrying any object initially
    state.carrying = None

    return state
```

This function ensures that the agent and the goal are placed uniformly across all open cells, including the bottom row, which should better match the distribution observed in the real-world samples.
