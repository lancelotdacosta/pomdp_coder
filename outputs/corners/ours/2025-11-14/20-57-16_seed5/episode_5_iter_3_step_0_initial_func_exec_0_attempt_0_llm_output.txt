Based on the provided samples, it appears that the distribution of initial states has the following characteristics:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent can appear at any valid position within the grid (excluding the walls).
2. **Goal Position**: The goal can also appear at any valid position within the grid (excluding the walls and the agent's position).
3. **Agent Direction**: The agent can face any direction (0, 1, 2, or 3).

The current implementation is mostly correct, but there are a few areas where it can be improved to better match the true distribution:

1. **Random Selection of Positions**: Ensure that the positions for the agent and the goal are selected independently and do not overlap.
2. **Uniform Distribution**: Ensure that each valid position has an equal probability of being chosen.
3. **Agent Direction**: Ensure that the agent's direction is randomly chosen with equal probability.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

### Explanation of Changes
1. **Independent Selection of Agent and Goal Positions**:
   - The positions for the agent and the goal are selected independently.
   - The goal position is selected first, and then removed from the list of valid positions to ensure it does not overlap with the agent's position.

2. **Uniform Distribution**:
   - Both the agent and goal positions are selected using `np.random.choice`, which ensures a uniform distribution over the valid positions.

3. **Agent Direction**:
   - The agent's direction is chosen randomly using `np.random.choice` with equal probability for each direction.

These changes should better match the true distribution of initial states in the environment.
