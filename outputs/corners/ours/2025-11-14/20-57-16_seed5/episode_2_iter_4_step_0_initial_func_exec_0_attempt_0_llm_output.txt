Based on the provided samples, the distribution of initial states appears to follow these patterns:

1. The grid is a 10x10 grid with walls around the perimeter (grid value `2`).
2. The agent's position (`agent_pos`) is somewhere within the interior of the grid, avoiding the walls.
3. The agent's direction (`agent_dir`) is uniformly distributed among the four possible directions (0, 1, 2, 3).
4. The agent is not carrying anything (`carrying=None`).
5. There is typically an object (grid value `10`) in the bottom row of the grid, but its exact position can vary.

Given this understanding, the `initial_func` function can be implemented as follows:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define the possible positions for the agent within the interior of the grid
    possible_positions = [(x, y) for x in range(1, 9) for y in range(1, 9)]

    # Randomly select an agent position
    agent_pos = np.random.choice(possible_positions)
    
    # Randomly select an agent direction
    agent_dir = np.random.randint(0, 4)
    
    # Place the object (value 10) in a random position in the bottom row
    bottom_row_positions = [(x, 8) for x in range(1, 9)]
    object_pos = np.random.choice(bottom_row_positions)
    empty_state.grid[object_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal
    
    # Ensure the selected agent position is not the same as the object position
    while agent_pos == object_pos:
        agent_pos = np.random.choice(possible_positions)
    
    # Create the initial state with the agent's position, direction, and the grid
    state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
    
    return state
```

This function initializes the environment by:
1. Generating a list of possible positions for the agent within the interior of the grid.
2. Randomly selecting an agent position from these possible positions.
3. Randomly selecting an agent direction.
4. Placing an object (value `10`) in a random position in the bottom row of the grid.
5. Ensuring the selected agent position is not the same as the object position.
6. Creating and returning the initial state with the agent's position, direction, and the grid.
