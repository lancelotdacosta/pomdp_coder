Certainly! Based on the provided samples, it seems like the environment is a 10x10 grid with walls around the edges. The agent can start at any open cell (not a wall), and the goal can be placed in any open cell as well, ensuring it is not the same as the agent's starting position. Additionally, the agent's direction can be any of the four possible directions.

The observed distribution suggests that the agent and the goal are equally likely to appear in any open cell, and the agent's direction is uniformly random.

Let's improve the `initial_func` function to better model this distribution:

```python
import numpy as np

def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Create a copy of the empty state to avoid modifying the original
    state = MinigridState(
        grid=np.copy(empty_state.grid),
        agent_pos=empty_state.agent_pos,
        agent_dir=empty_state.agent_dir,
        carrying=empty_state.carrying
    )

    # Get all positions within the grid that are not walls
    open_cells = np.where(state.grid == ObjectTypes.empty)
    open_cells = list(zip(open_cells[0], open_cells[1]))

    # Randomly select an open cell for the agent's initial position
    state.agent_pos = open_cells[np.random.randint(len(open_cells))]

    # Randomly select a direction for the agent
    state.agent_dir = np.random.randint(4)

    # Randomly place a goal object in an open cell, ensuring it is not the same as the agent's position
    goal_pos = open_cells[np.random.randint(len(open_cells))]
    while goal_pos == state.agent_pos:
        goal_pos = open_cells[np.random.randint(len(open_cells))]
    state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # The agent is not carrying any object initially
    state.carrying = None

    return state
```

This function should now generate initial states that more closely match the observed distribution. It ensures that both the agent and the goal are placed randomly in any open cell, and the agent's direction is uniformly random.
