The observed distribution of initial states suggests that the agent and the goal can appear anywhere in the valid positions (i.e., not on walls). The current implementation randomly selects positions for the agent and the goal, but it does not account for the possibility that the agent and the goal might be adjacent or in specific relative positions that are observed in the real world.

To better model the true distribution, we need to ensure that:
1. The agent and the goal can be placed in any valid position.
2. The agent and the goal can be adjacent or in specific relative positions as observed in the samples.

Here's the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    grid = empty_state.grid.copy()

    # Define the possible positions for the agent and goal
    valid_positions = []
    for i in range(1, grid.shape[0] - 1):
        for j in range(1, grid.shape[1] - 1):
            if grid[i, j] == ObjectTypes.empty:
                valid_positions.append((i, j))

    # Ensure valid_positions is not empty
    if not valid_positions:
        raise ValueError("No valid positions found for the agent or goal")

    # Randomly select a position for the goal
    goal_pos_idx = np.random.choice(len(valid_positions))
    goal_pos = valid_positions[goal_pos_idx]
    grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Remove the selected goal position from the list of valid positions
    valid_positions.pop(goal_pos_idx)

    # Ensure there are still valid positions left for the agent
    if not valid_positions:
        raise ValueError("No valid positions left for the agent after placing the goal")

    # Randomly select an initial position for the agent
    agent_pos_idx = np.random.choice(len(valid_positions))
    agent_pos = valid_positions[agent_pos_idx]

    # Randomly select an initial direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    return MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
```

This function ensures that the agent and the goal can be placed in any valid position, and it removes the selected positions to avoid overlap. The random selection of positions and directions should better reflect the observed distribution of initial states.
