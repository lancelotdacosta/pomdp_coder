The observed distribution of initial states suggests that the agent and the goal can appear in any open cell of the grid. However, the key observation is that the agent and the goal are never placed in the same cell or adjacent cells. This constraint ensures that the agent has a path to the goal and is not obstructed by the goal's position.

To improve the `initial_func` function, we need to ensure that the agent and the goal are placed in non-adjacent cells. We can achieve this by first placing the agent and then ensuring that the goal is placed at a sufficient distance from the agent.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Get the open cells in the grid
    open_cells = empty_state.get_type_indices(ObjectTypes.empty)
    
    if not open_cells:
        raise ValueError("No open cells available for placing the agent and goal.")

    # Randomly select a position for the agent from the open cells
    agent_pos = tuple(open_cells[np.random.choice(len(open_cells))])
    
    # Randomly select an initial direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.randint(0, 4)
    
    # Remove the agent's position and its adjacent cells from the open cells list
    adjacent_cells = [
        (agent_pos[0] + dx, agent_pos[1] + dy) for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    ]
    remaining_open_cells = [
        cell for cell in open_cells if cell != agent_pos and cell not in adjacent_cells
    ]
    
    if not remaining_open_cells:
        raise ValueError("No open cells available for placing the goal.")
    
    # Randomly select a position for the goal from the remaining open cells
    goal_pos = tuple(remaining_open_cells[np.random.choice(len(remaining_open_cells))])
    
    # Place the goal in the grid
    empty_state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal
    
    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None,
    )
    
    return initial_state
```

This function ensures that the agent and the goal are not placed in adjacent cells, which better models the true distribution of initial states.
