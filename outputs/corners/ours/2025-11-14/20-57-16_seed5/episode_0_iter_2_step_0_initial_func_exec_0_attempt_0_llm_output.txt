To better model the true distribution of initial states, we need to ensure that the agent and the goal are placed in valid positions that match the observed samples. The key differences between the real-world samples and the generated ones are:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent can be placed anywhere in the open cells.
2. **Goal Position**: The goal can be placed anywhere in the open cells, but it should not overlap with the agent's position.
3. **Direction**: The agent's direction is uniformly random.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function that better models the true distribution:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Get the open cells in the grid
    open_cells = empty_state.get_type_indices(ObjectTypes.empty)
    
    if not open_cells:
        raise ValueError("No open cells available for placing the agent and goal.")

    # Randomly select a position for the agent from the open cells
    agent_pos = tuple(open_cells[np.random.choice(len(open_cells))])
    
    # Randomly select an initial direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.randint(0, 4)
    
    # Randomly select a position for the goal from the remaining open cells
    remaining_open_cells = [cell for cell in open_cells if cell != agent_pos]
    if not remaining_open_cells:
        raise ValueError("No open cells available for placing the goal.")
    goal_pos = tuple(remaining_open_cells[np.random.choice(len(remaining_open_cells))])
    
    # Place the goal in the grid
    empty_state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal
    
    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None,
    )
    
    return initial_state
```

### Explanation of the Distribution

1. **Agent Position**: The agent is placed in a random open cell. This ensures that the agent can start anywhere in the environment.
2. **Goal Position**: The goal is placed in a random open cell, but it must be different from the agent's position. This ensures that the goal and the agent do not overlap.
3. **Direction**: The agent's direction is chosen uniformly at random from the four possible directions (right, down, left, up).

This approach should generate initial states that are more consistent with the observed real-world samples.
