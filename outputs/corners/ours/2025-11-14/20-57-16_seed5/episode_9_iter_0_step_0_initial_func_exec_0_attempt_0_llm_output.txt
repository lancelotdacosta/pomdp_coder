Based on the provided samples, it seems that the initial states are generated with the following characteristics:

1. **Grid Layout**: The grid is a 10x10 grid with walls (value `2`) around the perimeter and an empty interior (value `1`).
2. **Agent Position and Direction**: The agent can start at any position within the inner 8x8 grid (i.e., positions (1,1) to (8,8)). The agent's direction can be one of four possible values: facing right (`0`), facing down (`1`), facing left (`2`), or facing up (`3`).
3. **Goal Position**: The goal (value `10`) can be placed anywhere in the inner 8x8 grid, but it is not always present. If present, it is placed at a random position different from the agent's initial position.
4. **Carrying**: The agent is not carrying anything initially.

Given this understanding, here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:

This function initializes the environment by placing the agent at a random position within the inner grid and setting a random direction. It also randomly decides whether to place a goal at another random position within the inner grid. The `carrying` attribute is set to `None` as the agent does not carry anything initially.
