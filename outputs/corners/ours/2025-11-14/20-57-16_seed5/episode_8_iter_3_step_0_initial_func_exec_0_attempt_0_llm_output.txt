To better model the true distribution of initial states, we need to ensure that the agent and the goal are placed in a way that is consistent with the real-world samples. From the provided samples, it appears that the goal is often placed near the bottom of the grid, while the agent can be placed anywhere in the empty cells.

Here's the revised `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define the grid layout
    grid = empty_state.grid.copy()

    # Get all empty cells
    empty_cells = np.argwhere(grid == ObjectTypes.empty)

    # Place the goal object in one of the empty cells, biased towards the bottom half
    bottom_half_empty_cells = empty_cells[empty_cells[:, 0] >= grid.shape[0] // 2]
    if len(bottom_half_empty_cells) > 0:
        goal_pos = tuple(bottom_half_empty_cells[np.random.choice(len(bottom_half_empty_cells))])
    else:
        goal_pos = tuple(empty_cells[np.random.choice(len(empty_cells))])
    grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Choose a random position for the agent
    agent_pos = tuple(empty_cells[np.random.choice(len(empty_cells))])

    # Ensure the agent and goal are not in the same position
    while agent_pos == goal_pos:
        agent_pos = tuple(empty_cells[np.random.choice(len(empty_cells))])

    # Choose a random direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # Create the initial state
    return MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
```

### Explanation
1. **Goal Placement**: The goal is more likely to be placed in the bottom half of the grid. We achieve this by filtering the empty cells to only those in the bottom half and then randomly selecting one of these cells for the goal. If there are no empty cells in the bottom half, we fall back to placing the goal anywhere in the grid.
2. **Agent Placement**: The agent can be placed anywhere in the empty cells, but it must not overlap with the goal. We ensure this by checking and reselecting the agent's position until it is different from the goal's position.
3. **Direction**: The agent's direction is chosen randomly from the four possible directions.

This approach should better match the observed distribution of initial states, particularly the placement of the goal object.
