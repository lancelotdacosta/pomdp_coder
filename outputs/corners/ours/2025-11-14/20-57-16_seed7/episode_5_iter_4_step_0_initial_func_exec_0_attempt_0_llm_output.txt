Based on the samples provided, it seems that the distribution of initial states involves:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent can start at various positions within the grid, primarily near the walls or in the middle of the grid. The positions are not strictly limited to a few fixed points.
2. **Agent Direction**: The agent can face in any direction (right, down, left, up) with equal probability.
3. **Goal Position**: The goal can be placed in various positions within the grid, primarily near the walls.

To better model this distribution, we need to ensure that the agent and goal positions are more varied and not restricted to a few specific points. We can do this by sampling from a broader range of possible positions within the grid, while ensuring that the agent and goal do not overlap.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """

    # Define the grid size
    grid_height, grid_width = empty_state.grid.shape

    # Define possible agent and goal positions
    possible_positions = [
        (x, y)
        for x in range(1, grid_width - 1)
        for y in range(1, grid_height - 1)
        if empty_state.grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty
    ]

    # Sample a random agent position and direction
    agent_pos = np.random.choice(len(possible_positions))
    agent_pos = possible_positions[agent_pos]
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # Ensure the goal is placed in a different position than the agent
    possible_goal_positions = [pos for pos in possible_positions if pos != agent_pos]
    goal_pos_idx = np.random.choice(len(possible_goal_positions))
    goal_pos = possible_goal_positions[goal_pos_idx]

    # Place the goal in the grid
    empty_state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Place the agent in the grid
    empty_state.agent_pos = agent_pos
    empty_state.agent_dir = agent_dir

    return empty_state
```

This function ensures that both the agent and goal can be placed in any open (non-wall) position within the grid, and they do not overlap. This should better match the observed distribution of initial states.
