The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `np.random.choice` expects a 1-dimensional array, but `empty_cells` is a list of tuples. To fix this, we can use `np.random.choice` to select an index and then use that index to get the corresponding tuple from `empty_cells`.

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
import numpy as np

def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    
    # Constants for the grid dimensions
    width = empty_state.width
    height = empty_state.height
    
    # Find all empty cells where the agent can be placed
    empty_cells = [(x, y) for x in range(1, width - 1) for y in range(1, height - 1) if empty_state.grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty]
    
    # Ensure there are empty cells available
    if not empty_cells:
        raise ValueError("No empty cells available for the agent's initial position.")
    
    # Randomly select an index and get the corresponding empty cell for the agent's initial position
    agent_pos_index = np.random.choice(len(empty_cells))
    agent_pos = empty_cells[agent_pos_index]
    
    # Randomly select an initial direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))
    
    # Place a goal object in the grid, typically near the bottom-right corner
    goal_pos = (width - 2, height - 2)
    empty_state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal
    
    # Ensure the goal position is not the same as the agent's position
    while agent_pos == goal_pos:
        agent_pos_index = np.random.choice(len(empty_cells))
        agent_pos = empty_cells[agent_pos_index]
    
    # Create the initial state
    state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
    
    return state
```

In this corrected version, `np.random.choice` is used to select an index from the list of empty cells, and then the corresponding tuple is used for the agent's initial position. This ensures that `np.random.choice` operates on a 1-dimensional array of indices, which avoids the error you encountered.
