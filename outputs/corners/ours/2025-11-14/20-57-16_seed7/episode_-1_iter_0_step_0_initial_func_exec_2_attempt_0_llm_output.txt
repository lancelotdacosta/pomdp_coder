The error occurs because `np.random.choice` expects a 1-dimensional array, but `bottom_cells` is a list of tuples. To resolve this, we can flatten the list of tuples and then randomly select an index to get one of the tuples. Here's the corrected version of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define possible agent positions and directions
    possible_agent_positions = [
        (3, 3), (6, 4), (5, 3), (3, 3), (6, 2)
    ]
    possible_agent_directions = list(Direction)

    # Randomly select an agent position and direction
    agent_pos = possible_agent_positions[np.random.choice(len(possible_agent_positions))]
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(possible_agent_directions).value  # Directly use the integer value

    # Place a goal object in one of the bottom cells
    bottom_cells = [(8, 8), (9, 1), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 9)]
    goal_pos = bottom_cells[np.random.choice(len(bottom_cells))]

    # Create the grid with the goal object and walls
    grid = empty_state.grid.copy()
    grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return initial_state
```

In this corrected version:
- `agent_dir` is assigned the integer value directly using `.value`.
- `goal_pos` is selected by first choosing an index from the list of possible goal positions and then using that index to get the corresponding tuple.

This should resolve the `ValueError` you encountered.
