To improve the `initial_func` function, we need to ensure that the agent and the goal are placed in valid positions that do not overlap with each other or with walls. The current implementation has some issues where the agent and the goal might end up in the same position or in positions that are not valid (e.g., on walls).

Here's an improved version of the `initial_func` function that addresses these issues:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    grid = empty_state.grid.copy()
    width, height = grid.shape

    # Ensure the goal is placed in a valid position
    goal_pos = None
    while goal_pos is None or grid[goal_pos] != ObjectTypes.empty:
        goal_pos = (np.random.randint(1, width - 1), np.random.randint(1, height - 1))
    grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Ensure the agent is placed in a valid position and not on the goal
    agent_pos = None
    while agent_pos is None or grid[agent_pos] != ObjectTypes.empty or agent_pos == goal_pos:
        agent_pos = (np.random.randint(1, width - 1), np.random.randint(1, height - 1))
    grid[agent_pos] = ObjectTypes.agent

    # Randomly select an initial direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # Return the new state
    return MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
```

### Explanation of the Improved Function

1. **Goal Placement**:
   - We randomly select a position for the goal within the interior of the grid (excluding the walls).
   - We ensure that the selected position is empty before placing the goal.

2. **Agent Placement**:
   - We randomly select a position for the agent within the interior of the grid (excluding the walls).
   - We ensure that the selected position is empty and not the same as the goal's position before placing the agent.

3. **Agent Direction**:
   - We randomly select an initial direction for the agent from the list of possible directions.

By ensuring that the agent and the goal do not overlap and are placed in valid positions, this function should better model the true distribution of initial states.
