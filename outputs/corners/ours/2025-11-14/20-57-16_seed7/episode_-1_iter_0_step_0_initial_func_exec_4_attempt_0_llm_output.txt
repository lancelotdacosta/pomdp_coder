The error occurs because `np.random.choice` returns a NumPy integer (`numpy.int64`), which does not have a `value` attribute. Instead, you should directly use the integer value returned by `np.random.choice`. Here is the corrected version of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define possible agent positions and directions
    possible_agent_positions = [
        (3, 3), (6, 4), (5, 3), (3, 3), (6, 2)
    ]
    possible_agent_directions = list(Direction)

    # Randomly select an agent position and direction
    agent_pos = possible_agent_positions[np.random.choice(len(possible_agent_positions))]
    agent_dir = int(np.random.choice(possible_agent_directions))  # Directly use the integer value

    # Place a goal object in one of the bottom cells
    bottom_cells = [(8, 8), (9, 1), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 9)]
    goal_pos = bottom_cells[np.random.choice(len(bottom_cells))]

    # Create the grid with the goal object and walls
    grid = empty_state.grid.copy()
    grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return initial_state
```

In this corrected version:
- `agent_dir` is assigned the integer value directly by converting the result of `np.random.choice(possible_agent_directions)` to an integer using `int()`.
- `goal_pos` is selected by first choosing an index from the list of possible goal positions and then using that index to get the corresponding tuple.

This should resolve the `AttributeError` you encountered.
