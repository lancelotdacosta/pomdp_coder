Based on the provided samples, it seems that the distribution of initial states has the following characteristics:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent can start at various positions within the grid, but it is always placed in an empty cell (`ObjectTypes.empty`) and never on walls (`ObjectTypes.wall`).
2. **Agent Direction**: The agent can start facing any of the four directions (right, down, left, up) with equal probability.
3. **Carrying**: The agent does not carry any object initially.
4. **Grid Layout**: The grid is mostly empty except for the walls, and there is a goal object (`ObjectTypes.goal`) present in the grid. The goal object is often located near the bottom-right corner of the grid.

Given this information, we can implement the `initial_func` to sample initial states from this distribution. Here's the implementation:

```python
import numpy as np

def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    
    # Constants for the grid dimensions
    width = empty_state.width
    height = empty_state.height
    
    # Find all empty cells where the agent can be placed
    empty_cells = [(x, y) for x in range(1, width - 1) for y in range(1, height - 1) if empty_state.grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty]
    
    # Randomly select an empty cell for the agent's initial position
    agent_pos = np.random.choice(empty_cells)
    
    # Randomly select an initial direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))
    
    # Place a goal object in the grid, typically near the bottom-right corner
    goal_pos = (width - 2, height - 2)
    empty_state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal
    
    # Ensure the goal position is not the same as the agent's position
    while agent_pos == goal_pos:
        agent_pos = np.random.choice(empty_cells)
    
    # Create the initial state
    state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
    
    return state
```

This function initializes the agent's position and direction randomly among the empty cells, ensures that the goal object is placed at a typical position (bottom-right corner), and avoids placing the agent and goal in the same cell. This should provide a good approximation of the initial state distribution based on the provided samples.
