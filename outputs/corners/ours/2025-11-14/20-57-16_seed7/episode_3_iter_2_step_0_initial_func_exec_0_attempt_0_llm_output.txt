Based on the provided samples, it seems that the distribution of initial states has the following characteristics:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent can appear at any empty cell within the grid, except along the walls.
2. **Goal Position**: The goal object is also placed in an empty cell within the grid, and it can be in any of these cells, including the same cell as the agent.
3. **Direction**: The agent's direction (facing right, down, left, or up) is uniformly random.

The current implementation places the goal and the agent in separate positions, which might not fully capture the true distribution where the goal and the agent can sometimes occupy the same position. To improve the model, we will allow the goal and the agent to occupy the same position if that is a valid configuration in the real world.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    grid = empty_state.grid.copy()
    width, height = grid.shape

    # Get a list of all empty positions in the interior of the grid
    empty_positions = [
        (x, y)
        for x in range(1, width - 1)
        for y in range(1, height - 1)
        if grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty
    ]

    # Randomly place the goal object in one of the empty positions
    goal_pos_index = np.random.randint(len(empty_positions))
    goal_pos = empty_positions[goal_pos_index]
    grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Randomly place the agent in one of the remaining empty positions
    agent_pos_index = np.random.randint(len(empty_positions))
    agent_pos = empty_positions[agent_pos_index]
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # Create the initial state
    state = MinigridState(grid=grid, agent_pos=agent_pos, agent_dir=agent_dir, carrying=None)

    return state
```

In this improved version, the goal and the agent can potentially occupy the same position. This is achieved by not removing the goal position from the list of empty positions before placing the agent. This ensures that the distribution of initial states more closely matches the observed real-world distribution.
