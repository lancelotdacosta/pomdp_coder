The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `np.random.choice` expects a 1-dimensional array, but you are passing it a list of tuples. To fix this, you can use a different method to randomly select a position and direction for the agent.

Here's the corrected version of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """

    # Initialize the possible positions and directions for the agent
    possible_positions = [
        (3, 3), (5, 4), (5, 3), (6, 4), (6, 2)
    ]
    possible_directions = [1, 2, 0]

    # Randomly select a position and direction for the agent
    agent_pos = possible_positions[np.random.randint(len(possible_positions))]
    agent_dir = possible_directions[np.random.randint(len(possible_directions))]

    # Create the initial state with the selected position and direction
    state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    # Place the agent in the grid
    state.grid[agent_pos] = ObjectTypes.agent

    return state
```

In this version, `np.random.randint` is used to generate a random index, which is then used to select a position and direction from the lists. This ensures that the input to `np.random.choice` is 1-dimensional, thus avoiding the error.
