Based on the provided samples from the real world and the generated ones, it seems that the key differences lie in the placement and distribution of the goal object and the agent. Specifically, the real-world samples suggest that the goal object can be placed at various positions within the grid, and the agent can also be placed in different locations independently of the goal's position. However, the current implementation restricts the placement of the goal and the agent to the same set of empty positions, which might not reflect the true distribution.

To improve the model, we need to ensure that the goal and the agent can be placed independently in any valid empty position within the grid. This will allow for a more diverse and realistic distribution of initial states.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

### Explanation:
1. **Independent Placement of Goal and Agent**: The key improvement is that the goal and the agent are placed independently in different empty positions. This ensures a more diverse distribution of initial states.
2. **Empty Positions List**: We first gather all empty positions in the grid. Then, we randomly select a position for the goal and remove it from the list of empty positions. After that, we randomly select a position for the agent from the remaining empty positions.
3. **Random Direction**: The agent's direction is chosen randomly from the list of possible directions.

This approach should better match the true distribution of initial states observed in the real world.
