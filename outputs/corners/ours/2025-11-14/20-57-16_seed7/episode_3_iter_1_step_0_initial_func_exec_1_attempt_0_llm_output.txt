The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `np.random.choice` expects a 1-dimensional array, but `empty_positions` is a list of tuples. To fix this, you can use a different approach to select a random position from the list of tuples.

Here's the corrected version of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    grid = empty_state.grid.copy()
    width, height = grid.shape

    # Get a list of all empty positions in the interior of the grid
    empty_positions = [
        (x, y)
        for x in range(1, width - 1)
        for y in range(1, height - 1)
        if grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty
    ]

    # Randomly place the goal object in one of the empty positions
    goal_pos_index = np.random.randint(len(empty_positions))
    goal_pos = empty_positions.pop(goal_pos_index)
    grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Randomly place the agent in one of the remaining empty positions
    agent_pos_index = np.random.randint(len(empty_positions))
    agent_pos = empty_positions.pop(agent_pos_index)
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # Create the initial state
    state = MinigridState(grid=grid, agent_pos=agent_pos, agent_dir=agent_dir, carrying=None)

    return state
```

### Explanation:
1. **Generate Empty Positions**: We generate a list of all empty positions within the interior of the grid.
2. **Place Goal**: We choose a random index from the list of empty positions and use it to place the goal object. We then remove this position from the list of empty positions.
3. **Place Agent**: We choose another random index from the updated list of empty positions and use it to place the agent. We also remove this position from the list.
4. **Set Agent Direction**: We randomly choose the agent's direction from the four possible directions.
5. **Create State**: We create and return the initial state with the updated grid, agent position, and agent direction.

This approach ensures that `np.random.choice` is used correctly by selecting indices from a 1-dimensional list, and it prevents the goal and agent from overlapping.
