The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `np.random.choice` expects a 1-dimensional array, but `possible_positions` is a list of tuples. To resolve this, we need to flatten the list of positions and then map the chosen index back to the original tuple.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Extract the grid dimensions
    width, height = empty_state.width, empty_state.height

    # Define the possible positions for the agent, excluding walls and goal
    possible_positions = []
    for x in range(1, width - 1):
        for y in range(1, height - 1):
            if empty_state.grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
                possible_positions.append((x, y))

    # Sample a random index for the position
    if possible_positions:
        index = np.random.choice(len(possible_positions))
        agent_pos = possible_positions[index]
    else:
        raise ValueError("No valid positions found for the agent")

    # Sample a random direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.randint(0, 4)

    # Ensure the agent is not carrying any object initially
    carrying = None

    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=carrying
    )

    return initial_state
```

### Explanation:
1. **Extract the Grid Dimensions**: We get the width and height of the grid from the `empty_state`.
2. **Define Possible Positions**: We iterate over the grid to find all empty cells (excluding walls and the goal) and store their positions in a list.
3. **Sample a Random Position**: If there are valid positions, we sample a random index from the list of possible positions and use it to select the agent's position.
4. **Sample a Random Direction**: We randomly choose a direction for the agent from the four possible directions.
5. **Ensure No Carrying**: The agent does not carry any object initially.
6. **Create the Initial State**: We create and return the initial state using the sampled position, direction, and the provided grid.

This should resolve the `ValueError` and correctly sample an initial state for the environment.
