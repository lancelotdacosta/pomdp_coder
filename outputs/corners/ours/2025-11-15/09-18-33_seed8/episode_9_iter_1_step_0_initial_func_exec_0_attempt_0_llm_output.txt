Based on the provided samples, the distribution of initial states seems to have the following characteristics:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent can start at various positions within the grid, but it is always inside the grid, not touching the walls. The possible positions seem to be distributed across the grid but tend to avoid the corners and edges.
2. **Agent Direction**: The agent can start facing any of the four cardinal directions (right, down, left, up).
3. **Goal Object**: The goal object is always placed at a fixed position within the grid, specifically at `(8, 8)`.

To better model this distribution, we need to ensure that the agent's starting position is more varied and covers the entire grid, while avoiding the walls. We also need to ensure that the agent's direction is chosen randomly from the four possible directions.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
import random

def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # The goal is to model the distribution of initial states based on the provided samples.
    # The samples suggest that the agent can start at different positions and facing different directions,
    # but always in an empty grid except for the walls and a goal object.

    # Possible initial positions for the agent, avoiding the walls
    possible_agent_positions = [
        (x, y) for x in range(1, empty_state.width - 1) for y in range(1, empty_state.height - 1)
    ]

    # Possible initial directions for the agent
    possible_agent_directions = [0, 1, 2, 3]

    # Choose a random position and direction for the agent
    agent_pos = random.choice(possible_agent_positions)
    agent_dir = random.choice(possible_agent_directions)

    # Place the goal object at a fixed position
    empty_state.grid[8, 8] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Create the initial state with the chosen agent position and direction
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return initial_state
```

This function ensures that the agent's starting position is randomly chosen from all possible positions within the grid, excluding the walls. The agent's direction is also chosen randomly from the four possible directions. The goal object is placed at the fixed position `(8, 8)`, as observed in the samples.
