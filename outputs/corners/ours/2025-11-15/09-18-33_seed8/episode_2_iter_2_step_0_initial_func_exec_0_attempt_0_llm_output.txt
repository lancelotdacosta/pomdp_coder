Based on the provided samples, it seems that the distribution of initial states has the following characteristics:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent can be placed almost anywhere within the grid, except on the walls. However, there is a slight bias towards avoiding the goal tile, although this is not strictly enforced.

2. **Goal Position**: The goal can be placed almost anywhere within the grid, except on the walls. The goal can be placed in any open cell, including cells that might initially be occupied by the agent.

3. **Agent Direction**: The agent's direction is uniformly random.

4. **Carrying**: The agent does not carry anything initially.

To better model this true distribution, we need to ensure that the agent and goal can be placed in the same cell, and that the agent can be placed on the goal tile. Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    grid = empty_state.grid.copy()
    width, height = grid.shape

    # Sample a random position for the goal
    while True:
        goal_x, goal_y = np.random.randint(1, width - 1), np.random.randint(1, height - 1)
        if grid[goal_x, goal_y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
            grid[goal_x, goal_y] = ObjectTypes.goal
            break

    # Sample a random position for the agent
    while True:
        agent_x, agent_y = np.random.randint(1, width - 1), np.random.randint(1, height - 1)
        if grid[agent_x, agent_y] in [ObjectTypes.empty, ObjectTypes.goal]:
            agent_pos = (agent_x, agent_y)
            break

    # Sample a random direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    return MinigridState(grid=grid, agent_pos=agent_pos, agent_dir=agent_dir, carrying=None)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Goal Placement**: The goal is placed randomly in an empty cell, ensuring it is not on the wall.
2. **Agent Placement**: The agent can be placed in any empty cell or on the goal tile. This ensures that the agent and goal can occupy the same position, which was observed in the real samples.
3. **Agent Direction**: The agent's direction is still uniformly random, as this matches the observed distribution.

This improved function should better match the true distribution of initial states as seen in the provided samples.
