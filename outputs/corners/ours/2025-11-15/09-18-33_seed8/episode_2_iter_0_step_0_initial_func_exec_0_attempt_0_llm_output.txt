Based on the provided samples, it seems that the agent can appear at various positions within the environment, but with some constraints:

1. The agent's position is within the inner grid (excluding the walls).
2. The agent's direction is uniformly distributed among the four possible directions.
3. The agent is not carrying any object in all the provided samples.

To model this distribution, we will randomly select a valid position and direction for the agent. We will ensure that the agent does not spawn on a wall or in a position where it would be blocked by the walls.

Here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
# type: ignore
from __future__ import annotations

import numpy as np
from typing import Tuple, Optional

def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """

    def is_valid_position(pos: Tuple[int, int]) -> bool:
        """Check if the position is valid (not on a wall)."""
        return 1 <= pos[0] < empty_state.width - 1 and 1 <= pos[1] < empty_state.height - 1

    # Randomly select a valid position for the agent
    while True:
        agent_x = np.random.randint(1, empty_state.width - 1)
        agent_y = np.random.randint(1, empty_state.height - 1)
        if is_valid_position((agent_x, agent_y)):
            break

    # Randomly select a direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.choice([0, 1, 2, 3])

    # The agent is not carrying any object
    carrying = None

    # Create the initial state
    state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),
        agent_pos=(agent_x, agent_y),
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=carrying
    )

    return state
```

This function ensures that the agent's initial position is within the valid area of the grid and that its direction is randomly chosen from the four possible directions. The agent is not carrying any object, consistent with the provided samples.
