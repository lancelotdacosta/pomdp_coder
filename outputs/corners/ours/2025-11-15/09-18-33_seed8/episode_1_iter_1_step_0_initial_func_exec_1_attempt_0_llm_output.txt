The error you're encountering is due to the `np.random.choice` function expecting a 1-dimensional array. However, `possible_positions` is a list of tuples, which is 2-dimensional. To fix this, you can use `np.random.choice` to select an index and then use that index to select the position from `possible_positions`.

Here's the corrected implementation of `initial_func`:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define the possible positions and directions for the agent
    possible_positions = [
        (8, 4), (3, 3), (5, 3), (6, 4), (4, 6)
    ]
    possible_directions = [0, 1, 2, 3]

    # Randomly select an index for the position and direction
    pos_index = np.random.choice(len(possible_positions))
    dir_index = np.random.choice(len(possible_directions))

    # Get the selected position and direction
    agent_pos = possible_positions[pos_index]
    agent_dir = possible_directions[dir_index]

    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    # Place the agent in the selected position
    initial_state.grid[agent_pos] = ObjectTypes.agent

    return initial_state
```

### Explanation of the Changes
1. **Selecting an Index**: Instead of directly using `np.random.choice` on the list of positions, we first select a random index from the range of the length of `possible_positions` and `possible_directions`.
2. **Using the Selected Index**: We then use the selected indices to get the corresponding position and direction.

This approach ensures that `np.random.choice` is always used with a 1-dimensional array, which resolves the `ValueError` you encountered.
