### Explanation of the Distribution of Initial States

The distribution of initial states in this environment is characterized by:

1. **Grid Layout**: The grid has walls around the perimeter, and the interior cells are mostly empty except for one goal object.
2. **Agent Position**: The agent can be placed in any open cell (i.e., a cell that is not a wall or the goal).
3. **Agent Direction**: The agent's direction (facing right, down, left, or up) is chosen randomly.
4. **Goal Object**: The goal object is placed in a random open cell.

The provided samples show that the agent can start at various positions within the grid and face different directions. The goal object is also placed in different locations, ensuring that the environment is diverse and the agent must explore to find the goal.
