Based on the provided samples, it seems that the distribution of initial states has the following characteristics:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent can start at various positions within the grid, but it avoids the walls. It can be positioned anywhere in the interior of the grid (i.e., between the walls).
2. **Agent Direction**: The agent can face any of the four directions (right, down, left, up).
3. **Goal Object**: The goal object is always placed at a fixed position in the grid, specifically at (8, 8).

To improve the code to better model this distribution, we need to ensure that the agent's initial position and direction are chosen randomly from the valid range, and the goal object is always placed at the correct fixed position.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
import random

def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Possible initial positions for the agent, avoiding the walls
    possible_agent_positions = [
        (x, y) for x in range(1, empty_state.width - 1) for y in range(1, empty_state.height - 1)
    ]

    # Possible initial directions for the agent
    possible_agent_directions = [0, 1, 2, 3]

    # Choose a random position and direction for the agent
    agent_pos = random.choice(possible_agent_positions)
    agent_dir = random.choice(possible_agent_directions)

    # Place the goal object at a fixed position (8, 8)
    empty_state.grid[8, 8] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Create the initial state with the chosen agent position and direction
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),  # Ensure we don't modify the original grid
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return initial_state
```

### Explanation:
1. **Agent Position**: We generate all possible positions for the agent by iterating over the interior of the grid (excluding the walls). This ensures that the agent can start at any valid position.
2. **Agent Direction**: We define the possible directions and randomly choose one for the agent.
3. **Goal Object**: We place the goal object at the fixed position (8, 8) in the grid.
4. **Creating Initial State**: We create a new `MinigridState` object with the chosen agent position, direction, and the grid with the goal object placed correctly. We use `grid.copy()` to ensure that we do not modify the original `empty_state` grid.

This approach should better match the distribution of initial states observed in the real-world samples.
