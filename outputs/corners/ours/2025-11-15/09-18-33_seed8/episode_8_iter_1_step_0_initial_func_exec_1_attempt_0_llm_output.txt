The error you're encountering is due to the `np.random.choice` function being used with a list of tuples. The `np.random.choice` function expects a 1-dimensional array or list, but you are providing it with a list of tuples.

To fix this, you can use `random.choice` from the `random` module instead, which can handle lists of tuples directly. Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
# type: ignore
from __future__ import annotations

import numpy as np
import random
from typing import Tuple, Optional

def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define possible starting positions and directions for the agent
    possible_agent_positions = [
        (4, 6), (4, 3), (3, 4), (7, 7), (6, 4)
    ]
    possible_agent_directions = [0, 1, 2, 3]

    # Randomly select a starting position and direction for the agent
    agent_pos = random.choice(possible_agent_positions)
    agent_dir = random.choice(possible_agent_directions)

    # Place the agent in the grid
    grid = empty_state.grid.copy()
    grid[agent_pos] = ObjectTypes.agent

    # Optionally place a goal object in the grid
    if np.random.rand() < 0.5:
        goal_pos = (np.random.randint(1, 9), np.random.randint(1, 9))
        while grid[goal_pos] != ObjectTypes.empty:
            goal_pos = (np.random.randint(1, 9), np.random.randint(1, 9))
        grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Create the initial state
    state = MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return state
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Random Selection**: The `random.choice` function from the `random` module is used to select a random position and direction for the agent. This function can handle lists of tuples directly.
- **Grid Initialization**: The grid is initialized as a copy of the empty state's grid, and the agent is placed at the selected position.
- **Goal Object Placement**: With a 50% probability, a goal object is placed at a random empty cell within the grid.

This should resolve the error and allow the code to run correctly.
