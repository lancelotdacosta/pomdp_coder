To better model the true distribution of initial states based on the provided samples, we need to ensure that:

1. The agent can start at various positions within the inner grid (excluding the walls).
2. The goal cell can be placed at various positions within the inner grid, independent of the agent's position.
3. The agent's direction is chosen randomly.

The current implementation already covers these aspects, but it seems to have some bias or constraints that do not match the real-world samples. Let's refine the `initial_func` function to ensure the generated states are more representative of the observed distribution.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define the range for the inner grid where the agent and goal can start
    min_pos = 1
    max_pos = 8

    # Randomly select the agent's position within the inner grid
    agent_x = np.random.randint(min_pos, max_pos + 1)
    agent_y = np.random.randint(min_pos, max_pos + 1)

    # Randomly select the agent's direction
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # Ensure the grid has walls surrounding it
    grid = empty_state.grid.copy()

    # Place a goal cell at a random position within the inner grid, ensuring it is not the same as the agent's position
    while True:
        goal_x = np.random.randint(min_pos, max_pos + 1)
        goal_y = np.random.randint(min_pos, max_pos + 1)
        if (goal_x, goal_y) != (agent_x, agent_y):
            break

    grid[goal_x, goal_y] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=(agent_x, agent_y),
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return initial_state
```

### Explanation:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent's position is chosen randomly within the inner grid (1 to 8).
2. **Agent Direction**: The agent's direction is chosen randomly from the available directions.
3. **Goal Position**: The goal cell is placed at a random position within the inner grid, ensuring it does not overlap with the agent's position. This is achieved by a simple loop that generates new coordinates until they do not match the agent's position.

This approach ensures that the generated states are more representative of the observed distribution, as it allows for a wider range of possible configurations while maintaining the constraints of the environment.
