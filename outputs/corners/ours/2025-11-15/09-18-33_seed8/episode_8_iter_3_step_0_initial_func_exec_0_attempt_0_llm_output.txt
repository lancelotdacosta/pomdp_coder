Based on the provided samples, it appears that the distribution of initial states is as follows:

1. The grid dimensions are 10x10.
2. The walls are fixed and pre-filled in the grid.
3. The agent can start at various positions within the grid, but only in the open spaces (cells with value 1).
4. The agent's direction (facing) is also varied and can be one of four possible directions: right (0), down (1), left (2), or up (3).
5. The agent is not carrying any object initially.
6. There is a goal object (value 10) present in the grid, but its position is fixed in the samples.

Given this understanding, we can model the initial state distribution by randomly selecting a valid starting position and direction for the agent and ensuring that the grid is pre-filled with walls.

Here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    
    # Extract the grid from the empty state
    grid = empty_state.grid.copy()
    
    # Define the valid positions for the agent (open spaces)
    valid_positions = np.where(grid == ObjectTypes.empty)
    valid_positions = list(zip(valid_positions[0], valid_positions[1]))
    
    # Randomly select a valid position for the agent
    agent_pos = random.choice(valid_positions)
    
    # Randomly select an initial direction for the agent
    agent_dir = random.choice(list(Direction))
    
    # Ensure the goal object is present in the grid
    # Based on the samples, the goal object is always at position (8, 9)
    goal_position = (8, 9)
    grid[goal_position] = ObjectTypes.goal
    
    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
    
    return initial_state
```

This function randomly selects a valid starting position and direction for the agent from the open spaces in the grid. It also ensures that the goal object is present at a fixed position as observed in the provided samples. The `empty_state` parameter is assumed to have the walls pre-filled in the grid.
