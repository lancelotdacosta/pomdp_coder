Based on the provided samples, the distribution of initial states appears to have the following characteristics:

1. **Grid Layout**: The grid is a 10x10 grid with walls around the perimeter (denoted by `2`).
2. **Agent Position**: The agent can start at various positions within the grid, but it seems to be more common for the agent to start along the middle vertical line (column 4) or near the bottom of the grid (around row 8).
3. **Agent Direction**: The agent can start facing any direction (right, down, left, up).
4. **Carrying Object**: The agent starts not carrying any object.
5. **Environment Objects**: There is a single object (denoted by `10`) that appears in different positions in the grid.

Given these characteristics, the `initial_func` function will randomly place the agent and the object within the grid, ensuring that the agent does not start on a wall.

Here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:
