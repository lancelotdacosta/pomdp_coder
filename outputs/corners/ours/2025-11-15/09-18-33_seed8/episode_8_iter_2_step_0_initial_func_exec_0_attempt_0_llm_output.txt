Based on the provided samples, it appears that the distribution of initial states has the following characteristics:

1. **Grid Layout**:
   - The grid is 10x10 with walls (2) surrounding the entire environment.
   - There is a single goal object (10) placed randomly within the grid, but not on the walls.

2. **Agent Position and Direction**:
   - The agent's initial position is random within the grid, but not on the walls or on the goal object.
   - The agent's initial direction is random (facing right, down, left, or up).

3. **Carrying**:
   - The agent is not carrying any object initially.

Given these observations, we can implement the `initial_func` function to generate an initial state that follows this distribution.

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    
    # Define the grid size
    width = empty_state.width
    height = empty_state.height
    
    # Ensure the grid has walls pre-filled
    assert empty_state.grid[0, :].all() == ObjectTypes.wall and empty_state.grid[-1, :].all() == ObjectTypes.wall
    assert empty_state.grid[:, 0].all() == ObjectTypes.wall and empty_state.grid[:, -1].all() == ObjectTypes.wall
    
    # Place the goal object randomly within the grid, but not on the walls
    while True:
        goal_pos = (np.random.randint(1, width-1), np.random.randint(1, height-1))
        if empty_state.grid[goal_pos] == ObjectTypes.empty:
            empty_state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal
            break
    
    # Place the agent randomly within the grid, but not on the walls or on the goal
    while True:
        agent_pos = (np.random.randint(1, width-1), np.random.randint(1, height-1))
        if empty_state.grid[agent_pos] == ObjectTypes.empty:
            empty_state.agent_pos = agent_pos
            empty_state.grid[agent_pos] = ObjectTypes.agent
            break
    
    # Set the agent's direction randomly
    empty_state.agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))
    
    # Ensure the agent is not carrying anything initially
    empty_state.carrying = None
    
    return empty_state
```

This function initializes the grid by placing a goal object and the agent in random positions that are not on the walls or on each other. The agent's direction is also set randomly, and it starts without carrying any object.
