To better model the true distribution of initial states, we need to ensure that the agent and the goal are placed in valid positions without overlapping each other. The observed samples suggest that the goal can be placed at any valid empty position, and the agent can also be placed at any valid empty position, including the same row or column as the goal.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    grid = empty_state.grid.copy()
    width, height = grid.shape

    # Ensure the goal tile is placed at a valid location
    while True:
        goal_x, goal_y = np.random.randint(1, width - 1), np.random.randint(1, height - 1)
        if grid[goal_x, goal_y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
            grid[goal_x, goal_y] = ObjectTypes.goal
            break

    # Sample a random position for the agent
    while True:
        agent_x, agent_y = np.random.randint(1, width - 1), np.random.randint(1, height - 1)
        if grid[agent_x, agent_y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
            agent_pos = (agent_x, agent_y)
            break

    # Sample a random direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    return MinigridState(grid=grid, agent_pos=agent_pos, agent_dir=agent_dir, carrying=None)
```

### Explanation of the Improved Code

1. **Goal Placement**:
   - The goal is placed at a random valid empty position within the grid. This ensures that the goal is not placed on the walls or on an already occupied cell.

2. **Agent Placement**:
   - The agent is placed at a random valid empty position within the grid. This ensures that the agent is not placed on the walls, on the goal, or on any other occupied cell.

3. **Agent Direction**:
   - The agent's direction is sampled randomly from the possible directions (facing right, down, left, or up).

By following these steps, we ensure that the initial state is generated in a way that matches the observed distribution of initial states more closely. The agent and goal are placed independently and do not overlap, which aligns with the provided samples.
