To better model the true distribution of initial states, we need to ensure that the agent and the goal can be placed in a wider range of valid positions within the grid. The current implementation only places the agent and the goal in a small subset of possible positions, which is why the generated samples do not match the real-world distribution.

Here are the key points to improve the distribution:
1. The agent and the goal should be placed more randomly within the grid, ensuring they are not on the edges or walls.
2. The agent should be able to face any direction (0, 1, 2, 3) with equal probability.
3. Ensure that the agent and the goal do not overlap.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    
    # Get the dimensions of the grid
    width, height = empty_state.width, empty_state.height
    
    # Ensure the goal is placed in a valid position
    while True:
        goal_x, goal_y = np.random.randint(1, width - 1), np.random.randint(1, height - 1)
        if empty_state.grid[goal_x, goal_y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
            empty_state.grid[goal_x, goal_y] = ObjectTypes.goal
            break
    
    # Ensure the agent is placed in a valid position and not on the goal
    while True:
        agent_x, agent_y = np.random.randint(1, width - 1), np.random.randint(1, height - 1)
        if empty_state.grid[agent_x, agent_y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
            break
    
    # Set the agent's position and direction
    agent_dir = np.random.choice([0, 1, 2, 3])
    
    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),
        agent_pos=(agent_x, agent_y),
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
    
    return initial_state
```

This function ensures that both the agent and the goal are placed randomly within the valid positions of the grid (not on the edges or walls), and the agent can face any direction with equal probability. This should result in a more accurate representation of the true distribution of initial states.
