### Explanation of the Distribution

The distribution of initial states in the environment is as follows:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent is placed randomly in the inner 8x8 area of the grid (i.e., positions (1,1) to (8,8)). The agent can face any of the four directions (right, down, left, up).

2. **Goal Position**: The goal object is also placed randomly in the inner 8x8 area, but it must be in an empty cell and not the same as the agent's position.

### Improvements

1. **Avoid Overlap**: The previous implementation did not ensure that the agent and the goal do not occupy the same position. This has been fixed by ensuring that the goal position is chosen such that it does not overlap with the agent's position.
2. **Random Valid Position**: Both the agent and the goal are placed in a random valid position within the inner 8x8 area, ensuring that they do not overlap and are both on empty cells.

This improved code should better model the true distribution of initial states in the environment.
