The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `np.random.choice` expects a 1-dimensional array, but `valid_positions` is a list of tuples. To fix this, we need to ensure that we pass a 1-dimensional array to `np.random.choice`. One way to do this is to use `np.random.choice` to select an index from the list of valid positions and then use that index to get the actual position tuple.

Here is the revised implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Get the shape of the grid
    width, height = empty_state.width, empty_state.height

    # Find all valid positions for the agent (not walls)
    valid_positions = [
        (x, y) for x in range(1, width - 1) for y in range(1, height - 1)
        if empty_state.grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty
    ]

    # Place the goal object at a random position (not on the wall or the agent)
    if valid_positions:
        goal_idx = np.random.choice(len(valid_positions))
        goal_pos = valid_positions[goal_idx]
        empty_state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal
        del valid_positions[goal_idx]

        # Place the agent at a random valid position
        if valid_positions:
            agent_idx = np.random.choice(len(valid_positions))
            agent_pos = valid_positions[agent_idx]
            agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))

            # Update the state with the new agent position and direction
            return MinigridState(
                grid=empty_state.grid,
                agent_pos=agent_pos,
                agent_dir=agent_dir,
                carrying=None
            )
        else:
            raise ValueError("No valid positions left for the agent.")
    else:
        raise ValueError("No valid positions available for the goal object.")
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Checking if `valid_positions` is not empty**: Before attempting to place the goal or the agent, we check if there are any valid positions available. If not, we raise a `ValueError`.
2. **Using indices to select positions**: Instead of directly passing the list of tuples to `np.random.choice`, we pass the length of the list and use the resulting index to get the actual position tuple. This ensures that `np.random.choice` works correctly with 1-dimensional input.

This should resolve the `ValueError` you encountered and ensure that the function runs as expected.
