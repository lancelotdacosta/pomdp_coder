Based on the samples provided, it appears that the distribution of initial states has the following characteristics:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent can be placed anywhere in the grid except on the walls or the goal. However, there seems to be a slight bias towards placing the agent closer to the center of the grid.
2. **Goal Position**: The goal can be placed anywhere in the grid except on the walls. It is also placed in a way that it does not overlap with the agent's position.
3. **Direction**: The agent's direction (facing) is uniformly distributed among the four possible directions (right, down, left, up).

Given these observations, I will adjust the `initial_func` function to better reflect the true distribution. Specifically, I will ensure that the agent and the goal are placed in valid positions and that the agent is more likely to be placed near the center of the grid.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    
    # Get the dimensions of the grid
    width, height = empty_state.width, empty_state.height
    
    # Ensure the goal is placed in a valid position
    while True:
        goal_x, goal_y = np.random.randint(1, width - 1), np.random.randint(1, height - 1)
        if empty_state.grid[goal_x, goal_y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
            empty_state.grid[goal_x, goal_y] = ObjectTypes.goal
            break
    
    # Ensure the agent is placed in a valid position and not on the goal
    while True:
        # Slight bias towards the center of the grid
        agent_x = np.random.choice([np.random.randint(1, width - 1) for _ in range(5)])
        agent_y = np.random.choice([np.random.randint(1, height - 1) for _ in range(5)])
        if empty_state.grid[agent_x, agent_y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
            break
    
    # Set the agent's position and direction
    agent_dir = np.random.choice([0, 1, 2, 3])
    
    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),
        agent_pos=(agent_x, agent_y),
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
    
    return initial_state
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Goal Position**: The goal placement logic remains the same, ensuring it is placed in an empty cell within the grid.
2. **Agent Position**: To introduce a slight bias towards the center of the grid, I use `np.random.choice` to select multiple random positions and then choose one of them. This increases the likelihood of the agent being placed near the center without hard-coding specific indices.
3. **Direction**: The agent's direction is still uniformly distributed among the four possible directions.

This adjustment should better reflect the distribution observed in the real-world samples.
