The error you're encountering is due to the `np.random.choice` function expecting a 1-dimensional array, but you are providing it with a list of tuples. To fix this, you can use `random.choice` from the Python `random` module, which can handle lists of tuples directly.

Here's the corrected version of the `initial_func` function:

```python
import random

def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # The goal is to model the distribution of initial states based on the provided samples.
    # The samples suggest that the agent can start at different positions and facing different directions,
    # but always in an empty grid except for the walls and a goal object.

    # Possible initial positions for the agent
    possible_agent_positions = [(3, 3), (6, 4), (5, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)]

    # Possible initial directions for the agent
    possible_agent_directions = [0, 1, 2, 3]

    # Choose a random position and direction for the agent
    agent_pos = random.choice(possible_agent_positions)
    agent_dir = random.choice(possible_agent_directions)

    # Place the goal object at a fixed position
    empty_state.grid[8, 8] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Create the initial state with the chosen agent position and direction
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return initial_state
```

This should resolve the `ValueError: a must be 1-dimensional` issue by using `random.choice` instead of `np.random.choice`. The `random.choice` function is suitable for selecting elements from a list of tuples.
