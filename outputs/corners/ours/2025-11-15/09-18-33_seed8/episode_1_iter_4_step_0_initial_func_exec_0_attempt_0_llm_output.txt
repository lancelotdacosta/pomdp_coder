Based on the provided samples, it seems that the initial states have the following characteristics:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent can start at various positions within the grid, but typically not on the walls or the goal object (represented by 10).
2. **Agent Direction**: The agent's initial direction is uniformly distributed among the four possible directions (facing right, down, left, or up).
3. **Grid**: The grid is mostly filled with empty cells (1) and walls (2). There is always exactly one goal object (10) placed somewhere in the grid.
4. **Carrying**: The agent starts without carrying any objects.

To model this distribution, we will:
- Randomly select a valid position for the agent (not a wall or goal).
- Randomly set the agent's direction.
- Place a goal object at a random position in the grid, ensuring it does not overlap with the agent or walls.
- Ensure the agent is not placed on the goal object.

Here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Get the shape of the grid
    width, height = empty_state.width, empty_state.height

    # Find all valid positions for the agent (not walls)
    valid_positions = [
        (x, y) for x in range(1, width - 1) for y in range(1, height - 1)
        if empty_state.grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty
    ]

    # Place the goal object at a random position (not on the wall or the agent)
    goal_pos = np.random.choice(valid_positions)
    empty_state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal
    valid_positions.remove(goal_pos)

    # Place the agent at a random valid position
    agent_pos = np.random.choice(valid_positions)
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # Update the state with the new agent position and direction
    return MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
```
