Based on the provided samples, the distribution of initial states in the environment can be described as follows:

- The agent's initial position can vary across different locations within the grid, but it is typically placed in an open area (denoted by `1` in the grid).
- The agent's initial direction can also vary and can be one of four possible directions: facing right (0), down (1), left (2), or up (3).
- The grid contains walls (`2`), an empty goal tile (`10`), and open spaces (`1`).
- The agent starts with no items (`carrying=None`).

Given this distribution, we can implement the `initial_func` function to sample initial states that follow this distribution. Here is the implementation:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    grid = empty_state.grid.copy()
    width, height = grid.shape

    # Ensure the goal tile is placed at a valid location
    while True:
        goal_x, goal_y = np.random.randint(1, width - 1), np.random.randint(1, height - 1)
        if grid[goal_x, goal_y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
            grid[goal_x, goal_y] = ObjectTypes.goal
            break

    # Sample a random position for the agent
    while True:
        agent_x, agent_y = np.random.randint(1, width - 1), np.random.randint(1, height - 1)
        if grid[agent_x, agent_y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
            agent_pos = (agent_x, agent_y)
            break

    # Sample a random direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # Ensure the agent is not placed on the goal tile
    if grid[agent_pos[0], agent_pos[1]] == ObjectTypes.goal:
        grid[agent_pos[0], agent_pos[1]] = ObjectTypes.empty

    return MinigridState(grid=grid, agent_pos=agent_pos, agent_dir=agent_dir, carrying=None)
```

This function ensures that:
1. The goal tile is placed at a random valid location within the grid.
2. The agent's position is sampled from an open space in the grid.
3. The agent's direction is randomly chosen from the four possible directions.
4. The agent is not placed on the goal tile.

This implementation should provide a diverse set of initial states that match the distribution observed in the provided samples.
