The distribution of initial states in the Minigrid environment appears to have the following characteristics:

1. **Grid Structure**: The grid is a 10x10 grid with walls surrounding it (i.e., the first and last rows and columns are filled with walls, represented by `2`).

2. **Agent Position**: The agent can start at various positions within the grid, excluding the walls. The provided samples show the agent starting at different positions such as `(3, 3)`, `(5, 3)`, `(8, 4)`, and `(6, 2)`.

3. **Agent Direction**: The agent's initial direction is not fixed and can be any of the four possible directions: `facing_right (0)`, `facing_down (1)`, `facing_left (2)`, or `facing_up (3)`. The provided samples show the agent facing down (1) or left (2) most of the time.

4. **Carrying**: The agent does not carry any object initially (`carrying=None`).

5. **Grid Contents**: The grid mostly consists of empty cells (represented by `1`). There are a few specific cells with a goal cell (represented by `10`). The goal cell can appear at different positions in the grid, but it is often found near the bottom-right corner.

Based on these observations, we can model the initial state distribution as follows:

1. Randomly select the agent's position within the inner 8x8 grid (positions from `(1, 1)` to `(8, 8)`).
2. Randomly select the agent's direction.
3. Ensure that the grid has walls surrounding it and place a goal cell at a random position within the inner 8x8 grid.

Here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define the range for the inner grid where the agent can start
    min_pos = 1
    max_pos = 8

    # Randomly select the agent's position within the inner grid
    agent_x = np.random.randint(min_pos, max_pos + 1)
    agent_y = np.random.randint(min_pos, max_pos + 1)

    # Randomly select the agent's direction
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # Ensure the grid has walls surrounding it
    grid = empty_state.grid.copy()

    # Place a goal cell at a random position within the inner grid
    goal_x = np.random.randint(min_pos, max_pos + 1)
    goal_y = np.random.randint(min_pos, max_pos + 1)
    grid[goal_x, goal_y] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=(agent_x, agent_y),
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return initial_state
```

This function initializes the environment with the agent placed at a random position within the inner 8x8 grid, facing a random direction, and with a goal cell placed at a random position within the same grid. The walls surrounding the grid are already pre-filled in the `empty_state`.
