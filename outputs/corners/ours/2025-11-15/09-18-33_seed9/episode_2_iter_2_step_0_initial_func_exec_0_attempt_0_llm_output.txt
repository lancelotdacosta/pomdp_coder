Based on the provided samples from the real world, the distribution of initial states appears to have the following characteristics:

1. **Goal Position**: The goal can be placed at various positions within the grid, typically within the open area and not on the boundary.
2. **Agent Position**: The agent can be placed at various positions within the open area of the grid, and it is important to ensure the agent does not overlap with the goal or any walls.
3. **Agent Direction**: The agent can face in any direction (right, down, left, up).

To better model this distribution, we need to ensure that the goal and agent are placed in valid positions without overlapping each other or the walls. Additionally, the agent should be placed in a position where it is not obstructed by walls.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define possible goal positions based on the samples
    possible_goal_positions = []
    for x in range(1, 9):
        for y in range(1, 9):
            if empty_state.grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
                possible_goal_positions.append((x, y))
    
    # Randomly select a goal position
    goal_pos_index = np.random.choice(len(possible_goal_positions))
    goal_pos = possible_goal_positions[goal_pos_index]
    
    # Place the goal in the grid
    empty_state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal
    
    # Define possible agent positions within the open areas of the grid, excluding the goal position
    possible_agent_positions = []
    for x in range(1, 9):
        for y in range(1, 9):
            if empty_state.grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
                possible_agent_positions.append((x, y))
    
    # Randomly select an agent position
    agent_pos_index = np.random.choice(len(possible_agent_positions))
    agent_pos = possible_agent_positions[agent_pos_index]
    
    # Set a random direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))
    
    # Create the initial state
    state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
    
    return state
```

This function ensures that:
- The goal is placed in a valid open position within the grid.
- The agent is placed in a valid open position within the grid, ensuring it does not overlap with the goal or any walls.
- The agent's direction is randomly chosen from the possible directions.

By following these steps, the distribution of initial states generated by this function should more closely match the observed distribution from the real world.
