Based on the provided samples from the real world, it seems that both the agent's position and the goal's position are uniformly distributed within the interior of the grid, excluding the walls. The direction of the agent is also uniformly sampled from the four possible directions.

However, in your current implementation, the agent and the goal are being placed in the same iteration without considering that they should not overlap. This could lead to cases where the agent and the goal are placed at the same position, which is not observed in the real-world samples.

To improve the model, we need to ensure that the agent and the goal are placed in different positions. We can achieve this by sampling the positions independently and ensuring that they do not overlap.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """

    def is_valid_pos(pos):
        x, y = pos
        return 1 <= x < empty_state.width - 1 and 1 <= y < empty_state.height - 1

    def sample_pos():
        while True:
            x = np.random.randint(1, empty_state.width - 1)
            y = np.random.randint(1, empty_state.height - 1)
            if empty_state.grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
                return (x, y)

    def sample_agent_dir():
        return np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # Sample agent position
    agent_pos = sample_pos()

    # Place the goal, ensuring it does not overlap with the agent's position
    while True:
        goal_pos = sample_pos()
        if goal_pos != agent_pos:
            empty_state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal
            break

    # Sample agent direction
    agent_dir = sample_agent_dir()

    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None,
    )

    return initial_state
```

This function ensures that the agent and the goal are placed in different positions within the interior of the grid. The agent's direction is still uniformly sampled from the four possible directions. This should better match the distribution observed in the real-world samples.
