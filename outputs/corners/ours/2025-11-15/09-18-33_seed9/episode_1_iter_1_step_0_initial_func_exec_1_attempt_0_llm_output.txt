The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `np.random.choice` expects a 1-dimensional array, but you are passing it a list of tuples. To fix this, you can use a different method to select a random position from the list of possible positions.

Here's the corrected version of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Possible starting positions for the agent
    possible_positions = [(2, 3), (3, 3), (5, 3), (6, 2), (6, 4)]

    # Randomly select a starting position for the agent
    agent_pos = possible_positions[np.random.choice(len(possible_positions))]

    # Randomly select a direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # The agent is not carrying any object initially
    carrying = None

    # Set the goal object at a fixed position (9, 8)
    empty_state.grid[9, 8] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Create the initial state
    state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=carrying
    )

    return state
```

In this corrected version, `np.random.choice` is used to select an index from the list of possible positions, and then the corresponding position is chosen using that index. This avoids the error caused by passing a list of tuples directly to `np.random.choice`.
