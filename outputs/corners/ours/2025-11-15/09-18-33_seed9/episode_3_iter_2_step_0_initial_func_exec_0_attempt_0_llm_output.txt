Based on the provided samples, it appears that the initial states are distributed such that:

1. The grid is a 10x10 grid with walls around the perimeter (2s).
2. The agent can start at various positions within the grid, but always in an open cell (1s).
3. The agent's direction (0: right, 1: down, 2: left, 3: up) is also varied.
4. There is a single goal object (10) located at a random position within the grid, but not on the walls or where the agent starts.
5. The agent is not carrying any object initially.

Given this understanding, we can implement the `initial_func` function to sample from this distribution.

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    
    def is_valid_pos(pos, grid):
        """Check if the position is valid (not a wall and not already occupied)."""
        x, y = pos
        return 0 < x < 9 and 0 < y < 9 and grid[x, y] == 1
    
    # Flatten the grid to get all open positions
    open_positions = np.argwhere(empty_state.grid == 1)
    
    # Randomly select a position for the goal
    goal_pos = tuple(open_positions[np.random.choice(len(open_positions))])
    empty_state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal
    
    # Remove the goal position from the list of open positions
    open_positions = open_positions[~np.all(open_positions == goal_pos, axis=1)]
    
    # Randomly select a position for the agent
    agent_pos = tuple(open_positions[np.random.choice(len(open_positions))])
    
    # Randomly select a direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))
    
    # Update the state with the new agent position and direction
    state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
    
    return state
```

This function ensures that:
- The goal is placed at a random open position.
- The agent starts at a different random open position.
- The agent's direction is chosen randomly.
- The state is returned with the updated grid, agent position, and direction.
