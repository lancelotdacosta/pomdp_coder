Based on the provided samples, it seems that the agent can start at any empty cell within the grid, and the direction it faces is also variable. The goal object (type 10) is placed at a random empty cell, but it is more likely to be placed towards the bottom-right corner of the grid. This suggests a non-uniform distribution for the goal object's position.

To better model this distribution, we can introduce a weighted probability for placing the goal object. For simplicity, we will use a linear increasing weight from the top-left to the bottom-right of the grid. This means cells closer to the bottom-right are more likely to be chosen as the goal object's position.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

This code introduces a weighted probability distribution for placing the goal object, which increases linearly from the top-left to the bottom-right of the grid. This should better reflect the observed distribution in the real world samples.
