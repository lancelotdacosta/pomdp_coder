Based on the provided samples, it appears that the initial states have the following characteristics:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent can start at various positions within the grid, typically not too close to the walls. It seems to be uniformly distributed within the inner cells of the grid.
2. **Agent Direction**: The agent's initial direction (facing right, down, left, or up) is also uniformly random.
3. **Object (Goal) Position**: The object with type 10 (goal) is placed at a position within the grid, typically not too close to the walls and not at the same position as the agent.

To better model this distribution, we need to ensure that the agent and the goal are placed in valid positions and that these positions are chosen uniformly from the possible positions.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

This improved function ensures that the agent and the goal are placed in valid positions within the grid, and their positions are chosen uniformly from the available positions. This should better match the observed distribution of initial states.
