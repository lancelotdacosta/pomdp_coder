### Explanation of the Initial State Distribution

Based on the provided samples, the initial state distribution appears to be as follows:

1. **Grid Layout**: The grid is a 10x10 grid with walls around the perimeter.
2. **Agent Position**: The agent can start at any empty (non-wall) position within the grid.
3. **Agent Direction**: The agent's initial direction is uniformly random (right, down, left, up).
4. **Goal Object**: There is one goal object placed in a random empty (non-wall) position within the grid.

The function `initial_func` implements this logic by:
- Ensuring that the goal object is placed in a random empty position.
- Ensuring that the agent is placed in a random empty position that is different from the goal object's position.
- Randomizing the agent's initial direction.
