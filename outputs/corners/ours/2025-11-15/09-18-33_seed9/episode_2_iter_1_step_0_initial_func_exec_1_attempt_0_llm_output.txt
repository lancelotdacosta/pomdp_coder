The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `np.random.choice` expects a 1-dimensional array, but `possible_goal_positions` is a list of tuples. To fix this, we can convert the list of tuples into a 1-dimensional array and then use `np.random.choice` to select an index, which we can use to get the corresponding tuple.

Here is the corrected version of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define possible goal positions based on the samples
    possible_goal_positions = [
        (1, 8), (9, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (6, 4)
    ]
    
    # Randomly select a goal position
    goal_pos_index = np.random.choice(len(possible_goal_positions))
    goal_pos = possible_goal_positions[goal_pos_index]
    
    # Place the goal in the grid
    empty_state.grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal
    
    # Define possible agent positions within the open areas of the grid
    possible_agent_positions = []
    for x in range(1, 9):
        for y in range(1, 9):
            if empty_state.grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
                possible_agent_positions.append((x, y))
    
    # Randomly select an agent position
    agent_pos_index = np.random.choice(len(possible_agent_positions))
    agent_pos = possible_agent_positions[agent_pos_index]
    
    # Set a random direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))
    
    # Create the initial state
    state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
    
    return state
```

In this version, we use `np.random.choice` to select an index from the length of the list of possible goal positions and agent positions. This index is then used to retrieve the corresponding tuple from the list. This ensures that `np.random.choice` is used correctly and the code runs without errors.
