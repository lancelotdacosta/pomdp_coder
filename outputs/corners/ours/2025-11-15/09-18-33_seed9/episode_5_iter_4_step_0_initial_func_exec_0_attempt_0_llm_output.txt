To better model the true distribution of initial states, we need to ensure that the placement of the agent and the goal object is more aligned with the real-world samples. Specifically, we observe that:

1. The agent is placed in a valid empty cell, which is usually not too close to the walls.
2. The goal object is also placed in a valid empty cell, ensuring it does not overlap with the agent.

Given these observations, we can improve the `initial_func` function by ensuring that the agent and goal are placed more centrally within the grid, and that they do not overlap. Additionally, we will ensure that the agent's position and direction are more representative of the real-world samples.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Get the dimensions of the grid
    width, height = empty_state.width, empty_state.height
    
    # Define a central region for placing the agent and goal to avoid the walls
    min_x, max_x = 1, width - 2
    min_y, max_y = 1, height - 2

    # Sample a random position for the agent within the central region
    while True:
        x, y = np.random.randint(min_x, max_x + 1), np.random.randint(min_y, max_y + 1)
        if empty_state.grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
            break
    
    # Sample a random direction for the agent
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))
    
    # Place the goal object in a random position within the central region, ensuring it doesn't overlap with the agent
    while True:
        goal_x, goal_y = np.random.randint(min_x, max_x + 1), np.random.randint(min_y, max_y + 1)
        if empty_state.grid[goal_x, goal_y] == ObjectTypes.empty and (goal_x, goal_y) != (x, y):
            empty_state.grid[goal_x, goal_y] = ObjectTypes.goal
            break
    
    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),
        agent_pos=(x, y),
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )
    
    return initial_state
```

This improved function ensures that both the agent and the goal are placed within a central region of the grid, avoiding the walls. This should better align with the observed distribution in the real-world samples.
