Based on the provided samples, it appears that the initial state distribution has the following characteristics:

1. **Agent and Goal Placement**:
   - The agent and goal can appear at any position within the inner 8x8 grid (excluding the walls).
   - The agent and goal positions do not overlap.
   - The agent can face any of the four directions (right, down, left, up).

2. **Grid Layout**:
   - The grid is a 10x10 grid with walls (2) around the perimeter.
   - The inner 8x8 grid is initially empty (1), except for the agent and goal positions.

Given these observations, the `initial_func` function should ensure that:
- The agent and goal are placed in random positions within the inner 8x8 grid.
- The agent and goal do not occupy the same position.
- The agent's direction is chosen randomly from the four possible directions.

Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

This function ensures that the agent and goal are placed randomly within the inner 8x8 grid, and the agent's direction is chosen randomly from the four possible directions. The `possible_positions` list is shuffled to ensure randomness, and the first two positions are used for the goal and agent, respectively. This should better match the observed distribution of initial states.
