To better model the true distribution of initial states, we need to ensure that the agent and goal positions are more diverse and aligned with the observed samples. The current implementation places the agent and goal in a fixed set of positions, which limits the diversity of the initial states.

Based on the provided samples, it appears that the agent and goal can be placed in various positions within the grid, as long as they are not on the walls. Additionally, the agent's direction should be sampled uniformly.

Here's an improved version of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """

    def is_valid_pos(pos):
        x, y = pos
        return 1 <= x < empty_state.width - 1 and 1 <= y < empty_state.height - 1

    def sample_agent_pos():
        while True:
            x = np.random.randint(1, empty_state.width - 1)
            y = np.random.randint(1, empty_state.height - 1)
            if empty_state.grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
                return (x, y)

    def sample_agent_dir():
        return np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    def place_goal():
        while True:
            x = np.random.randint(1, empty_state.width - 1)
            y = np.random.randint(1, empty_state.height - 1)
            if empty_state.grid[x, y] == ObjectTypes.empty:
                empty_state.grid[x, y] = ObjectTypes.goal
                return (x, y)

    # Sample agent position and direction
    agent_pos = sample_agent_pos()
    agent_dir = sample_agent_dir()

    # Place the goal
    place_goal()

    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None,
    )

    return initial_state
```

### Explanation of the Changes:

1. **Agent Position Sampling**:
   - The `sample_agent_pos` function now samples positions uniformly from all valid empty cells within the grid. This ensures that the agent can start in a wide variety of positions, not just a fixed set.

2. **Agent Direction Sampling**:
   - The `sample_agent_dir` function remains the same, sampling one of the four possible directions uniformly.

3. **Goal Position Sampling**:
   - The `place_goal` function now samples positions uniformly from all valid empty cells within the grid. This ensures that the goal can be placed in a wide variety of positions, not just a fixed set.

By making these changes, the distribution of initial states generated by the `initial_func` function will more closely match the observed distribution in the real world.
