Certainly! Let's break down the problem and then improve the `transition_func` function accordingly.

### Explanation of the Distribution

1. **Agent Movement**:
   - When the agent takes the `forward` action (action 2), it should move one cell in the direction it is facing, provided the cell is not blocked by a wall or other obstacles.
   - If the cell in front of the agent is empty (`ObjectTypes.empty`), the agent should move into that cell.
   - If the cell in front of the agent contains a goal (`ObjectTypes.goal`), the agent should also move into that cell.
   - If the cell in front of the agent contains a wall (`ObjectTypes.wall`), the agent should remain in its current position.

2. **Agent Turning**:
   - When the agent takes the `left` action (action 0), it should turn 90 degrees to the left.
   - When the agent takes the `right` action (action 1), it should turn 90 degrees to the right.

3. **Other Actions**:
   - Actions such as `pickup`, `drop`, `toggle`, and `done` are not relevant for this specific problem, so we will ignore them for now.

### Improved `transition_func` Function

Here is the improved `transition_func` function that better models the true distribution:

```python
def transition_func(state: MinigridState, action: int) -> MinigridState:
    new_state = MinigridState(
        grid=state.grid.copy(),
        agent_pos=state.agent_pos,
        agent_dir=state.agent_dir,
        carrying=state.carrying
    )

    if action == Actions.left:
        new_state.agent_dir = (new_state.agent_dir - 1) % 4
    elif action == Actions.right:
        new_state.agent_dir = (new_state.agent_dir + 1) % 4
    elif action == Actions.forward:
        front_pos = new_state.front_pos
        if (0 <= front_pos[0] < new_state.width and 
            0 <= front_pos[1] < new_state.height and 
            (new_state.grid[front_pos] == ObjectTypes.empty or 
             new_state.grid[front_pos] == ObjectTypes.goal)):
            new_state.agent_pos = front_pos

    return new_state
```

### Explanation of the Changes

1. **Agent Movement**:
   - The condition for moving forward now checks if the cell in front of the agent is either empty or a goal.
   - This ensures that the agent can move into a goal cell, which was missing in the previous implementation.

2. **Boundary Checks**:
   - The boundary checks ensure that the agent does not move out of the grid boundaries.

3. **Agent Turning**:
   - The turning logic remains the same as it was correctly implemented in the previous version.

This improved function should better model the true distribution of next states conditioned on actions and previous states.
