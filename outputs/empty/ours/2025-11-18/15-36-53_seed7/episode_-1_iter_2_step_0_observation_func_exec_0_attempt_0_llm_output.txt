To better model the true distribution of observations conditioned on a state, we need to ensure that the agent's field of view (FOV) is correctly calculated and that the agent's position and direction are accurately reflected in the observation. The main issues in the provided code are:

1. **Incorrect FOV Calculation**: The FOV calculation does not correctly handle the agent's direction, leading to misaligned or incorrect views.
2. **Agent Position in FOV**: The agent's position is not correctly marked in the FOV.
3. **Action Handling**: The action handling needs to be more precise, especially for the `forward` action to ensure the agent moves correctly and does not move into walls.

Here is the improved `observation_func` function:

```python
def observation_func(state, action, empty_obs):
    """
    Args:
        state (MinigridState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the previous action that was taken
        empty_obs (MinigridObservation): an empty observation that needs to be filled and returned
    Returns:
        obs (MinigridObservation): observation of the agent
    """
    view_size = 3  # The size of the field of view (3x3 grid)

    # Update the agent's position and direction based on the action
    if action == Actions.left:
        state.agent_dir = (state.agent_dir - 1) % 4
    elif action == Actions.right:
        state.agent_dir = (state.agent_dir + 1) % 4
    elif action == Actions.forward:
        # Compute the new position
        new_pos = np.array(state.agent_pos) + DIR_TO_VEC[state.agent_dir]
        # Check if the new position is within the grid and not a wall
        if 0 <= new_pos[0] < state.grid.shape[0] and 0 <= new_pos[1] < state.grid.shape[1]:
            if state.grid[new_pos[0], new_pos[1]] != ObjectTypes.wall:
                state.agent_pos = tuple(new_pos)

    # Get the field of view of the agent
    fov = state.get_field_of_view(view_size)

    # Create the observation
    empty_obs.image = fov
    empty_obs.agent_pos = state.agent_pos
    empty_obs.agent_dir = state.agent_dir
    empty_obs.carrying = state.carrying

    # Mark the agent's position in the FOV
    agent_pos_in_fov = (view_size // 2, view_size - 1)
    fov[agent_pos_in_fov] = ObjectTypes.agent

    return empty_obs
```

### Explanation

1. **Action Handling**:
   - **Turn Left/Right**: The agent's direction is updated correctly by adjusting the `state.agent_dir` value.
   - **Move Forward**: The new position is computed and checked to ensure it is within the grid and not a wall. If valid, the agent's position is updated.

2. **Field of View Calculation**:
   - The `get_field_of_view` method is used to get the FOV based on the agent's current position and direction.
   - The agent's position in the FOV is marked correctly at the center of the bottom row of the FOV (for a 3x3 grid, this is `(1, 2)`).

3. **Observation Creation**:
   - The FOV, agent's position, direction, and carried object are set in the `empty_obs` object to create the final observation.

This improved function should more accurately model the true distribution of observations conditioned on the state.
