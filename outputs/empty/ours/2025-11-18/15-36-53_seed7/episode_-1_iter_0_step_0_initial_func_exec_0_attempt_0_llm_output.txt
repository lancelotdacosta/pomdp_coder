From the provided samples, it appears that the environment is a 5x5 grid with walls around the perimeter (value `2`). The agent consistently starts at position `(1, 1)` and faces right (direction `0`). There are no objects carried by the agent (`carrying=None`). Additionally, there is a goal object (value `10`) located at position `(3, 3)`.

Given this pattern, the distribution of initial states can be summarized as follows:
- The grid is always 5x5.
- The agent starts at position `(1, 1)` and faces right (direction `0`).
- The grid has walls around the perimeter.
- There is a goal object at position `(3, 3)`.

Here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Ensure the grid is 5x5 and has walls around the perimeter
    assert empty_state.grid.shape == (5, 5)
    assert np.all(empty_state.grid[0, :] == ObjectTypes.wall)
    assert np.all(empty_state.grid[-1, :] == ObjectTypes.wall)
    assert np.all(empty_state.grid[:, 0] == ObjectTypes.wall)
    assert np.all(empty_state.grid[:, -1] == ObjectTypes.wall)

    # Set the agent's position and direction
    empty_state.agent_pos = (1, 1)
    empty_state.agent_dir = Direction.facing_right

    # Set the goal object at position (3, 3)
    empty_state.grid[3, 3] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Ensure the agent is not carrying anything
    empty_state.carrying = None

    return empty_state
```

This function initializes the state by setting the agent's position, direction, and placing the goal object in the correct location. It also ensures that the grid has the correct dimensions and wall structure.
