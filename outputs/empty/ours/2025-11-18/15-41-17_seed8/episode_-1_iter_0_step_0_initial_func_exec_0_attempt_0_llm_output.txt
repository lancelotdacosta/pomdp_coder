Based on the provided samples, the distribution of initial states appears to be as follows:

- The agent always starts at position (1, 1) in the grid.
- The agent's direction is always facing right (0).
- The agent is not carrying any object initially.
- The grid is a 5x5 grid with walls around the perimeter (2).
- There is a goal object (10) located at (3, 3).

Given this information, the `initial_func` function can be implemented to generate an initial state that matches this distribution.

Here is the implementation of `initial_func`:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Initialize the agent's position and direction
    agent_pos = (1, 1)
    agent_dir = Direction.facing_right
    carrying = None

    # Initialize the grid with walls and the goal object
    grid = empty_state.grid.copy()
    grid[1, 1] = ObjectTypes.empty
    grid[3, 3] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Create the initial state
    state = MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=carrying
    )

    return state
```

This function initializes the agent's position, direction, and the grid with the goal object at the specified location. It ensures that the walls are already pre-filled in the `empty_state` grid. The agent starts at position (1, 1) facing right, and initially does not carry any object.
