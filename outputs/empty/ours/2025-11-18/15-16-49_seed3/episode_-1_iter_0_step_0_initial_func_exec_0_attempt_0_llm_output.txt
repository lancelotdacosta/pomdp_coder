Based on the provided environment samples, it appears that the distribution of initial states is consistent with the following characteristics:

1. The agent is always positioned at `(1, 1)`.
2. The agent is always facing right (direction `0`).
3. The agent is not carrying any object.
4. The grid is a 5x5 grid with walls around the edges (walls are represented by `2`).
5. There is a goal object (`10`) located at different positions within the grid, but always inside the walls.

Given this understanding, I will implement the `initial_func` function to sample an initial state from this distribution.

```python
# type: ignore
from __future__ import annotations

import numpy as np
from typing import Tuple, Optional

def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    
    # The agent's position is always (1, 1)
    agent_pos = (1, 1)
    
    # The agent always faces right (0)
    agent_dir = 0
    
    # The agent is not carrying any object
    carrying = None
    
    # The grid is a 5x5 grid with walls around the edges
    grid = empty_state.grid.copy()
    
    # Place the goal object at a random position inside the grid
    while True:
        goal_x = np.random.randint(1, 4)
        goal_y = np.random.randint(1, 4)
        if grid[goal_x, goal_y] == 1:  # Ensure the position is empty
            grid[goal_x, goal_y] = 10
            break
    
    # Create and return the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=carrying
    )
    
    return initial_state
```

This implementation ensures that the agent is always placed at `(1, 1)` facing right, and a goal object is randomly placed in one of the internal empty cells of the grid. The function will return a valid initial state that matches the provided samples.
