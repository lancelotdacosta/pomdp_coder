Based on the provided samples, it appears that the distribution of initial states has the following characteristics:

- The agent's starting position is always at (1, 1).
- The agent's direction is always facing right (0).
- The agent is not carrying any object initially.
- The grid layout is consistent with the walls being present at the boundaries and the goal object (10) is always located at (3, 3).

Given this information, the `initial_func` function can be implemented as follows:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Set the agent's position and direction
    agent_pos = (1, 1)
    agent_dir = 0  # Facing right

    # Set the carrying object to None
    carrying = None

    # Ensure the goal object is placed at (3, 3)
    empty_state.grid[3, 3] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=carrying
    )

    return initial_state
```

This function sets the agent's starting position, direction, and ensures that the goal object is placed at the correct position in the grid. The `empty_state` is assumed to have the walls pre-filled.
