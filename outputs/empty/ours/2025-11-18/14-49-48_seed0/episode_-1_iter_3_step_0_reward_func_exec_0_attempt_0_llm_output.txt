The issue in your current `reward_func` is that it always penalizes the agent for hitting a wall when the action is `forward`, even if the agent successfully moves to the next position without hitting a wall. The penalty should only be applied if the agent's movement results in a collision with a wall.

To improve the `reward_func`, we need to ensure that the penalty for hitting a wall is only applied when the agent actually collides with a wall. If the agent successfully moves forward and avoids a wall, no penalty should be applied. Additionally, we should ensure that the reward function does not penalize the agent for actions that are valid and do not result in any negative outcomes.

Here is the improved `reward_func`:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (MinigridState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (MinigridState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    
    # Check if the agent has reached the goal
    goal_positions = next_state.get_type_indices(ObjectTypes.goal)
    if any(next_state.agent_pos == pos for pos in goal_positions):
        return 1.0, True

    # Penalize for hitting a wall
    front_pos = state.front_pos
    if state.grid[front_pos] == ObjectTypes.wall and action == Actions.forward and state.agent_pos == next_state.agent_pos:
        return -1.0, False

    # Penalize for picking up an object when there is none
    if action == Actions.pickup and next_state.carrying is None:
        return -1.0, False

    # Penalize for dropping an object when the agent is not carrying one
    if action == Actions.drop and next_state.carrying is None:
        return -1.0, False

    # Penalize for toggling an object when it is not a door or other toggle-able object
    if action == Actions.toggle and next_state.grid[front_pos] not in [ObjectTypes.open_door, ObjectTypes.closed_door, ObjectTypes.locked_door]:
        return -1.0, False

    # Default reward for other actions
    return 0.0, False
```

### Explanation:
1. **Goal Check**: If the agent moves to a position that is a goal, the reward is 1.0 and the episode is done.
2. **Wall Collision Check**: The penalty for hitting a wall is applied only if the agent's movement results in no change in the agent's position (`state.agent_pos == next_state.agent_pos`), indicating a collision with a wall.
3. **Pickup Action Check**: A penalty is applied if the agent attempts to pick up an object but there is none to pick up.
4. **Drop Action Check**: A penalty is applied if the agent attempts to drop an object when it is not carrying one.
5. **Toggle Action Check**: A penalty is applied if the agent attempts to toggle an object that is not a door or other toggle-able object.

This should better align with the true distribution and avoid penalties for actions that are valid and do not result in negative outcomes.
