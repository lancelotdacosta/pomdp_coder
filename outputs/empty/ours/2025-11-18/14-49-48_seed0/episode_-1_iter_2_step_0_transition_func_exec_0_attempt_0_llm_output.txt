Certainly! Let's analyze the problem and improve the `transition_func` to better model the true distribution of next states.

### Explanation

1. **Agent Position and Movement**:
   - When the agent performs the `forward` action, it should move to the cell in front of it if the cell is empty.
   - The current implementation correctly checks if the cell in front is within bounds and if it is empty. However, it fails to move the agent to the goal cell when the cell in front is a goal (object type 10).

2. **Agent Direction**:
   - The `left` and `right` actions are correctly implemented to change the agent's direction.

3. **Pickup and Drop Actions**:
   - The `pickup` action is correctly implemented to pick up objects if the cell in front contains a key, ball, or box.
   - The `drop` action is correctly implemented to drop objects if the cell in front is empty and the agent is carrying an object.

4. **Toggle Action**:
   - The `toggle` action is not implemented in this example, which is fine for now.

### Improved `transition_func`

Here is the improved `transition_func` function:

```python
def transition_func(state, action):
    if action == Actions.left:
        # Turn left
        new_agent_dir = (state.agent_dir - 1) % 4
        new_state = MinigridState(
            grid=state.grid.copy(),
            agent_pos=state.agent_pos,
            agent_dir=new_agent_dir,
            carrying=state.carrying
        )
    elif action == Actions.right:
        # Turn right
        new_agent_dir = (state.agent_dir + 1) % 4
        new_state = MinigridState(
            grid=state.grid.copy(),
            agent_pos=state.agent_pos,
            agent_dir=new_agent_dir,
            carrying=state.carrying
        )
    elif action == Actions.forward:
        # Move forward
        front_pos = np.array(state.agent_pos) + DIR_TO_VEC[state.agent_dir]
        if 0 <= front_pos[0] < state.width and 0 <= front_pos[1] < state.height:
            if state.grid[tuple(front_pos)] in [ObjectTypes.empty, ObjectTypes.goal]:
                new_agent_pos = tuple(front_pos)
                new_state = MinigridState(
                    grid=state.grid.copy(),
                    agent_pos=new_agent_pos,
                    agent_dir=state.agent_dir,
                    carrying=state.carrying
                )
            else:
                new_state = state
        else:
            new_state = state
    elif action == Actions.pickup:
        # Pick up an object
        front_pos = np.array(state.agent_pos) + DIR_TO_VEC[state.agent_dir]
        if 0 <= front_pos[0] < state.width and 0 <= front_pos[1] < state.height:
            if state.grid[tuple(front_pos)] in [ObjectTypes.key, ObjectTypes.ball, ObjectTypes.box]:
                new_grid = state.grid.copy()
                new_grid[tuple(front_pos)] = ObjectTypes.empty
                new_state = MinigridState(
                    grid=new_grid,
                    agent_pos=state.agent_pos,
                    agent_dir=state.agent_dir,
                    carrying=state.grid[tuple(front_pos)]
                )
            else:
                new_state = state
        else:
            new_state = state
    elif action == Actions.drop:
        # Drop an object
        if state.carrying is not None:
            front_pos = np.array(state.agent_pos) + DIR_TO_VEC[state.agent_dir]
            if 0 <= front_pos[0] < state.width and 0 <= front_pos[1] < state.height:
                if state.grid[tuple(front_pos)] == ObjectTypes.empty:
                    new_grid = state.grid.copy()
                    new_grid[tuple(front_pos)] = state.carrying
                    new_state = MinigridState(
                        grid=new_grid,
                        agent_pos=state.agent_pos,
                        agent_dir=state.agent_dir,
                        carrying=None
                    )
                else:
                    new_state = state
            else:
                new_state = state
        else:
            new_state = state
    elif action == Actions.toggle:
        # Toggle/activate an object (not implemented for this example)
        new_state = state
    elif action == Actions.done:
        # Indicate the task is completed (no change in state)
        new_state = state
    return new_state
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Forward Action**:
   - The `forward` action now checks if the cell in front is either `empty` (1) or `goal` (10). If it is, the agent moves to that cell.

This should better model the true distribution of next states based on the provided examples and the environment description.
