To improve the `observation_func` function, we need to ensure that the agent's field of view (FOV) is correctly generated based on the agent's current position, direction, and the action taken. The issues in the provided samples suggest that the FOV generation is not correctly accounting for the agent's direction and the orientation of the grid.

### Explanation of the Observation Distribution

1. **Agent's Direction**: The agent's direction determines the orientation of the FOV. The FOV should be rotated based on the agent's direction to match the agent's perspective.
2. **Field of View (FOV)**: The FOV should be a 3x3 grid centered around the agent's position, with the agent at the center. The FOV should be clipped to the grid boundaries and should not show out-of-bounds areas.
3. **Action Effects**: Actions like turning left or right should update the agent's direction, but they should not affect the FOV generation directly. The FOV should always be generated based on the updated direction.

### Improved `observation_func`

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Rotation of FOV**: The `get_field_of_view` function is correctly rotating the FOV based on the agent's direction. However, the rotation should only be applied based on the agent's direction, not the action taken.
2. **Action Application**: The `apply_action` function correctly updates the agent's position and direction based on the action. This ensures that the agent's state is updated before generating the FOV.
3. **FOV Generation**: The `get_observation` function generates the FOV based on the updated state, ensuring that the FOV is aligned with the agent's current direction.

These changes should align the generated observations with the expected distribution in the real world.
