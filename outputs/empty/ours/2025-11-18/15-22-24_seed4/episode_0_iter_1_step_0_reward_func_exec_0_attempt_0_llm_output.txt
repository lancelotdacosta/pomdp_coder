Certainly! Let's analyze the discrepancies between the observed real-world behavior and the current model.

### Analysis of Discrepancies:

1. **Turning In Place**:
   - If the agent turns in place (left or right), and no other significant changes occur, the reward should be `0` and the episode should not be done. Your current model was giving `-0.1` for these cases.

2. **Moving into an Object**:
   - If the agent moves forward (`forward` action) into an object that is not a wall (e.g., a goal, key, ball, etc.), the reward should be `0` and the episode should not be done. Your current model was giving `-1` for these cases.

3. **Moving into an Empty Cell**:
   - If the agent moves forward into an empty cell, the reward should be `0` and the episode should not be done. Your current model was giving `-1` for these cases.

4. **Dropping an Object**:
   - If the agent drops an object and it lands on an empty cell or another object, the reward should be `0` and the episode should not be done. Your current model was giving `-1` for these cases.

5. **Picking Up an Object**:
   - If the agent picks up an object and it is a valid action (i.e., the object is in front of the agent), the reward should be `0` and the episode should not be done. Your current model was giving `-1` for these cases.

### Improved Reward Function:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (MinigridState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (MinigridState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Check if the agent has reached the goal
    goal_pos = next_state.get_type_indices(ObjectTypes.goal)
    if goal_pos and next_state.agent_pos in goal_pos:
        return 1, True

    # Check if the agent has moved into a wall
    front_pos = next_state.front_pos
    if state.grid[front_pos] == ObjectTypes.wall:
        return -1, False

    # Check if the agent has taken an action that does not change its position
    if state.agent_pos == next_state.agent_pos and action != Actions.done:
        # Only penalize if the agent is not turning in place
        if action not in [Actions.left, Actions.right]:
            return -0.1, False
        else:
            return 0, False

    # Check if the agent has moved forward into an object or empty cell
    if action == Actions.forward and state.agent_pos != next_state.agent_pos:
        front_pos = next_state.agent_pos
        if state.grid[front_pos] != ObjectTypes.wall:
            return 0, False

    # Check if the agent has dropped an object on an empty cell or another object
    if action == Actions.drop and state.carrying is not None and next_state.carrying is None:
        return 0, False

    # Check if the agent has picked up an object
    if action == Actions.pickup and state.carrying is None and next_state.carrying is not None:
        return 0, False

    # If none of the above conditions are met, the reward is 0 and the episode is not done
    return 0, False
```

### Explanation:

1. **Goal Reached**:
   - If the agent reaches the goal, the reward is `1` and the episode is done.

2. **Moving into a Wall**:
   - If the agent moves forward into a wall, the reward is `-1` and the episode continues.

3. **Turning In Place**:
   - If the agent turns in place (left or right), the reward is `0` and the episode continues.

4. **Moving into an Object or Empty Cell**:
   - If the agent moves forward into an object or an empty cell, the reward is `0` and the episode continues.

5. **Dropping an Object**:
   - If the agent drops an object, the reward is `0` and the episode continues.

6. **Picking Up an Object**:
   - If the agent picks up an object, the reward is `0` and the episode continues.

This should better align with the observed real-world behavior and improve the accuracy of your model.
