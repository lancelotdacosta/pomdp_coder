Certainly! Let's first describe the reward conditioned on state, action, and next state transition in English:

### Reward Conditions:
1. **Goal Achievement**: If the agent moves into a cell containing a goal, the reward is 1 and the episode is done.
2. **Wall Collision**: If the agent moves into a wall, the reward is -1 and the episode continues.
3. **Ineffective Actions**:
   - If the agent performs an action that does not change its position (except for turning left or right), the reward is -0.1.
   - If the agent turns left or right, the reward is 0.
4. **Forward Movement**:
   - If the agent moves forward into an empty cell or an object (but not a wall or goal), the reward is 0.
5. **Pickup/Drop**:
   - If the agent picks up an object when it was not carrying one, the reward is 0.
   - If the agent drops an object when it was carrying one, the reward is 0.

### Updated Code:
Here is the improved `reward_func` function:

```python
def reward_func(state: MinigridState, action: int, next_state: MinigridState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (MinigridState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (MinigridState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Check if the agent has reached the goal
    goal_pos = next_state.get_type_indices(ObjectTypes.goal)
    if goal_pos and next_state.agent_pos in goal_pos:
        return 1, True

    # Check if the agent has moved into a wall
    front_pos = next_state.front_pos
    if next_state.grid[front_pos] == ObjectTypes.wall and action == Actions.forward:
        return -1, False

    # Check if the agent has taken an action that does not change its position
    if state.agent_pos == next_state.agent_pos and action != Actions.done:
        # Only penalize if the agent is not turning in place
        if action not in [Actions.left, Actions.right]:
            return -0.1, False
        else:
            return 0, False

    # Check if the agent has moved forward into an object or empty cell
    if action == Actions.forward and state.agent_pos != next_state.agent_pos:
        front_pos = next_state.agent_pos
        if next_state.grid[front_pos] != ObjectTypes.wall and next_state.grid[front_pos] != ObjectTypes.goal:
            return 0, False

    # Check if the agent has dropped an object on an empty cell or another object
    if action == Actions.drop and state.carrying is not None and next_state.carrying is None:
        return 0, False

    # Check if the agent has picked up an object
    if action == Actions.pickup and state.carrying is None and next_state.carrying is not None:
        return 0, False

    # If none of the above conditions are met, the reward is 0 and the episode is not done
    return 0, False
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Wall Collision**: The condition for wall collision now specifically checks if the action was `forward` and the next position is a wall.
2. **Ineffective Actions**: The penalty for ineffective actions (actions that do not change the agent's position) is only applied if the action is not `left` or `right`.
3. **Forward Movement**: The reward for moving forward into an object or empty cell (but not a wall or goal) is 0.

These changes should better align the reward function with the observed behavior in the real world.
