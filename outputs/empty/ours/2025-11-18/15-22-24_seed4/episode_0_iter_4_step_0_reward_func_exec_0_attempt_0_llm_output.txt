Certainly! Let's analyze the problem and refine the `reward_func` to better match the true distribution of the environment.

### Analysis

1. **Goal Reached**:
   - If the agent reaches a goal cell, the reward is 1 and the episode is done.

2. **Moving into a Wall**:
   - If the agent attempts to move forward into a wall, the reward is -1 and the episode continues.

3. **Turning In Place**:
   - If the agent turns left or right while staying in the same position, the reward is 0 and the episode continues.

4. **Other Actions**:
   - If the agent takes an action that does not change its position (except for turning), the reward is -0.1 and the episode continues.
   - If the agent moves forward into an empty cell or any other object that is not a wall, the reward is 0 and the episode continues.
   - If the agent picks up or drops an object, the reward is 0 and the episode continues.

### Improved `reward_func`

Here is the improved `reward_func`:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (MinigridState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (MinigridState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Check if the agent has reached the goal
    goal_pos = next_state.get_type_indices(ObjectTypes.goal)
    if goal_pos and next_state.agent_pos in goal_pos:
        return 1, True

    # Check if the agent has moved into a wall
    front_pos = state.front_pos
    if action == Actions.forward and state.grid[front_pos] == ObjectTypes.wall:
        return -1, False

    # Check if the agent has taken an action that does not change its position
    if state.agent_pos == next_state.agent_pos:
        if action == Actions.left or action == Actions.right:
            return 0, False
        elif action != Actions.done:
            return -0.1, False
        else:
            return 0, False

    # Check if the agent has moved forward into an object or empty cell
    if action == Actions.forward and state.agent_pos != next_state.agent_pos:
        front_pos = next_state.agent_pos
        if state.grid[front_pos] != ObjectTypes.wall:
            return 0, False

    # Check if the agent has dropped an object on an empty cell or another object
    if action == Actions.drop and state.carrying is not None and next_state.carrying is None:
        return 0, False

    # Check if the agent has picked up an object
    if action == Actions.pickup and state.carrying is None and next_state.carrying is not None:
        return 0, False

    # If none of the above conditions are met, the reward is 0 and the episode is not done
    return 0, False
```

### Explanation

1. **Goal Reached**:
   - The condition `if goal_pos and next_state.agent_pos in goal_pos:` checks if the agent is on a goal cell in the next state.

2. **Moving into a Wall**:
   - The condition `if action == Actions.forward and state.grid[front_pos] == ObjectTypes.wall:` checks if the agent attempts to move forward into a wall.

3. **Turning In Place**:
   - The condition `if state.agent_pos == next_state.agent_pos and (action == Actions.left or action == Actions.right):` checks if the agent turns left or right while staying in the same position.

4. **Other Actions**:
   - The condition `if state.agent_pos == next_state.agent_pos and action != Actions.done:` checks if the agent takes an action that does not change its position.
   - The condition `if action == Actions.forward and state.agent_pos != next_state.agent_pos and state.grid[front_pos] != ObjectTypes.wall:` checks if the agent moves forward into a cell that is not a wall.
   - The conditions for picking up and dropping objects check if these actions are performed correctly.

This should better match the true distribution of the environment based on the provided samples.
