Based on the provided samples, it seems that the initial states have the following characteristics:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent can start in various positions within the grid, not limited to the positions (2, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3). It can also start at positions like (1, 3) and (2, 2) with different grid configurations.
2. **Agent Direction**: The agent can face any of the four directions (right, down, left, up).
3. **Grid Configuration**: The key is always placed at position (5, 2) and the goal is at (8, 3). However, the positions of other objects (like walls and empty spaces) can vary, especially around the agent's starting position.

To better model this distribution, we need to expand the possible starting positions for the agent and ensure that the grid configuration is consistent with the provided samples. Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """

    # Define the fixed structure of the grid
    grid = np.array([
        [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
        [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2],
        [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2],
        [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2],
        [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2],
        [2, 2, 2, 6, 2, 2],
        [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2],
        [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2],
        [2, 1, 1, 10, 1, 2],
        [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2],
        [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
    ], dtype=np.int8)

    # Define the possible agent positions within a wider range
    agent_positions = [
        (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4),
        (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4),
        (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4),
        (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
    ]

    # Define the possible agent directions
    agent_directions = [Direction.facing_right, Direction.facing_down, Direction.facing_left, Direction.facing_up]

    # Randomly select an agent position and direction
    agent_pos = agent_positions[np.random.choice(len(agent_positions))]
    agent_dir = agent_directions[np.random.choice(len(agent_directions))]

    # Create the initial state
    state = MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return state
```

This updated function expands the possible starting positions for the agent to a wider range within the grid, ensuring that the initial states are more varied and closer to the true distribution observed in the real world. The key and goal positions remain fixed as specified.
