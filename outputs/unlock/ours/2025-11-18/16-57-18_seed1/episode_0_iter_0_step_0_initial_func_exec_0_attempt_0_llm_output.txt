Based on the provided samples, the distribution of initial states can be described as follows:

1. **Agent Position and Direction**:
   - The agent's initial position is typically within the inner grid (not along the walls) and varies across different positions.
   - The agent's direction is predominantly either facing right (0) or facing up (3).

2. **Grid Configuration**:
   - The grid has fixed walls (2) around the perimeter.
   - There is a key (7) located in one of the inner cells.
   - There is a locked door (6) located at a specific position.
   - There is a goal (10) located in one of the inner cells.

Given this, we can model the initial state distribution by randomly selecting an appropriate initial position and direction for the agent, while ensuring the grid configuration remains consistent.

Here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:
