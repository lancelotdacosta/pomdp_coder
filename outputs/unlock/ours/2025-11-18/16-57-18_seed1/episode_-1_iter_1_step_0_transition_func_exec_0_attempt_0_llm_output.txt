Certainly! The issue in your current `transition_func` lies in how the `toggle` action is handled. Specifically, when the agent toggles a locked door while carrying a key, the door should become an open door, and the key should be consumed. However, in your current implementation, the door becomes a closed door instead of an open door.

Here's the improved `transition_func`:

```python
def transition_func(state, action):
    """
    Args:
        state (MinigridState): the state of the environment 
        action (int): action to be taken in state `state`
    Returns:
        new_state (MinigridState): the new state of the environment
    """
    def is_valid_pos(pos):
        x, y = pos
        return 0 <= x < state.width and 0 <= y < state.height and state.grid[x, y] != ObjectTypes.wall

    agent_pos = np.array(state.agent_pos)
    agent_dir = state.agent_dir
    carrying = state.carrying
    grid = state.grid.copy()

    if action == Actions.left:
        # Turn left
        agent_dir = (agent_dir - 1) % 4
    elif action == Actions.right:
        # Turn right
        agent_dir = (agent_dir + 1) % 4
    elif action == Actions.forward:
        # Move forward
        new_pos = agent_pos + DIR_TO_VEC[agent_dir]
        if is_valid_pos(new_pos):
            agent_pos = new_pos.tolist()
    elif action == Actions.pickup:
        # Pick up an object
        front_pos = np.array(state.front_pos)
        if grid[front_pos[0], front_pos[1]] in [ObjectTypes.key, ObjectTypes.ball, ObjectTypes.box]:
            carrying = grid[front_pos[0], front_pos[1]]
            grid[front_pos[0], front_pos[1]] = ObjectTypes.empty
    elif action == Actions.drop:
        # Drop an object
        front_pos = np.array(state.front_pos)
        if grid[front_pos[0], front_pos[1]] == ObjectTypes.empty and carrying is not None:
            grid[front_pos[0], front_pos[1]] = carrying
            carrying = None
    elif action == Actions.toggle:
        # Toggle/activate an object
        front_pos = np.array(state.front_pos)
        obj_type = grid[front_pos[0], front_pos[1]]
        if obj_type in [ObjectTypes.closed_door, ObjectTypes.open_door, ObjectTypes.locked_door]:
            if obj_type == ObjectTypes.closed_door:
                grid[front_pos[0], front_pos[1]] = ObjectTypes.open_door
            elif obj_type == ObjectTypes.locked_door and carrying == ObjectTypes.key:
                grid[front_pos[0], front_pos[1]] = ObjectTypes.open_door
                carrying = None
            elif obj_type == ObjectTypes.open_door:
                grid[front_pos[0], front_pos[1]] = ObjectTypes.closed_door
    elif action == Actions.done:
        # Done completing the task
        pass

    new_state = MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=tuple(agent_pos),
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=carrying
    )
    return new_state
```

### Explanation of the Distribution of Next States Conditioned on Actions and Previous States

1. **Turn Left (Actions.left)**: The agent's direction is decremented by 1 (modulo 4) to simulate a left turn.
2. **Turn Right (Actions.right)**: The agent's direction is incremented by 1 (modulo 4) to simulate a right turn.
3. **Move Forward (Actions.forward)**: The agent attempts to move forward in the direction it is facing. If the next cell is valid (not a wall), the agent moves to that cell.
4. **Pick Up (Actions.pickup)**: The agent checks the cell in front of it. If the cell contains a key, ball, or box, the agent picks it up and the cell becomes empty.
5. **Drop (Actions.drop)**: The agent checks the cell in front of it. If the cell is empty and the agent is carrying an object, the agent drops the object in the cell and stops carrying it.
6. **Toggle (Actions.toggle)**: The agent checks the cell in front of it. If the cell contains a closed door, it becomes an open door. If the cell contains a locked door and the agent is carrying a key, the door becomes an open door and the agent no longer carries the key. If the cell contains an open door, it becomes a closed door.
7. **Done (Actions.done)**: The agent does nothing.

This improved `transition_func` correctly handles the toggling of locked doors, ensuring that they become open doors when the agent has the key, matching the observed behavior in the real world.
