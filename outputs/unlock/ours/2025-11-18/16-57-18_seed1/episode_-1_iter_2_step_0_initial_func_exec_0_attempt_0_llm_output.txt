To better model the true distribution of initial states, we need to analyze the provided samples and identify the patterns in the agent's starting positions and directions. Here are the key observations:

1. **Agent Positions**:
   - The agent can start at various positions, but it seems to favor the top-left region of the grid.
   - Possible positions include (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 1), (1, 3).

2. **Agent Directions**:
   - The agent can face any direction (0, 1, 2, 3).
   - The samples show a uniform distribution of directions.

3. **Fixed Objects**:
   - The locked door is always at (3, 3).
   - The key is always at (5, 3).
   - The goal is always at (9, 3).

4. **Grid Layout**:
   - The grid has walls around the edges and a fixed layout of objects as described above.
   - The agent's starting position should not overlap with these fixed objects.

Based on these observations, we can improve the `initial_func` function to better model the true distribution of initial states. Here is the updated code:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define the fixed objects in the grid
    fixed_objects = [
        (3, 3, ObjectTypes.locked_door),  # Locked door at (3, 3)
        (5, 3, ObjectTypes.key),          # Key at (5, 3)
        (9, 3, ObjectTypes.goal)          # Goal at (9, 3)
    ]

    # Place the fixed objects in the grid
    for x, y, obj_type in fixed_objects:
        empty_state.grid[x, y] = obj_type

    # Define the possible agent positions
    possible_agent_positions = [
        (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3)
    ]
    possible_agent_directions = [0, 1, 2, 3]

    # Randomly select an agent position and direction
    agent_pos = tuple(possible_agent_positions[np.random.randint(len(possible_agent_positions))])
    agent_dir = possible_agent_directions[np.random.randint(len(possible_agent_directions))]

    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=empty_state.grid.copy(),
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return initial_state
```

This updated function:
1. Places the fixed objects (locked door, key, and goal) in their respective positions.
2. Defines a list of possible agent starting positions based on the observed samples.
3. Randomly selects an agent position and direction from the defined lists.
4. Creates and returns the initial state with the selected agent position and direction.

This should better match the observed distribution of initial states.
