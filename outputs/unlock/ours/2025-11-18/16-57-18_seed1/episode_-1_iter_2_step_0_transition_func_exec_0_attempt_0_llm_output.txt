Certainly! Let's first explain the distribution of next states conditioned on actions and previous states in English, and then we'll improve the `transition_func` function.

### Explanation

1. **Agent Movement**:
   - The agent can move forward if the cell in front of it is not a wall.
   - The agent can turn left or right, changing its direction accordingly.
   - The agent can pick up objects (key, ball, box) from the cell in front of it if it is not carrying anything.
   - The agent can drop an object onto the cell in front of it if that cell is empty and the agent is carrying something.
   - The agent can toggle objects (doors) in front of it:
     - A closed door becomes open.
     - An open door becomes closed.
     - A locked door becomes closed if the agent is carrying a key, and the key is consumed.

2. **Observation**:
   - In the provided example, the agent is facing right (direction 0) and is carrying a key (object type 7).
   - The action `5` (toggle) is taken when the agent is in front of a locked door (object type 6).

3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - When the agent toggles a locked door while carrying a key, the locked door should become an open door, and the key should be consumed.

### Improved `transition_func`

```python
def transition_func(state, action):
    """
    Args:
        state (MinigridState): the state of the environment 
        action (int): action to be taken in state `state`
    Returns:
        new_state (MinigridState): the new state of the environment
    """
    def is_valid_pos(pos):
        x, y = pos
        return 0 <= x < state.width and 0 <= y < state.height and state.grid[x, y] != ObjectTypes.wall

    agent_pos = np.array(state.agent_pos)
    agent_dir = state.agent_dir
    carrying = state.carrying
    grid = state.grid.copy()

    if action == Actions.left:
        # Turn left
        agent_dir = (agent_dir - 1) % 4
    elif action == Actions.right:
        # Turn right
        agent_dir = (agent_dir + 1) % 4
    elif action == Actions.forward:
        # Move forward
        new_pos = agent_pos + DIR_TO_VEC[agent_dir]
        if is_valid_pos(new_pos):
            agent_pos = new_pos.tolist()
    elif action == Actions.pickup:
        # Pick up an object
        front_pos = np.array(state.front_pos)
        if grid[front_pos[0], front_pos[1]] in [ObjectTypes.key, ObjectTypes.ball, ObjectTypes.box]:
            carrying = grid[front_pos[0], front_pos[1]]
            grid[front_pos[0], front_pos[1]] = ObjectTypes.empty
    elif action == Actions.drop:
        # Drop an object
        front_pos = np.array(state.front_pos)
        if grid[front_pos[0], front_pos[1]] == ObjectTypes.empty and carrying is not None:
            grid[front_pos[0], front_pos[1]] = carrying
            carrying = None
    elif action == Actions.toggle:
        # Toggle/activate an object
        front_pos = np.array(state.front_pos)
        obj_type = grid[front_pos[0], front_pos[1]]
        if obj_type in [ObjectTypes.closed_door, ObjectTypes.open_door, ObjectTypes.locked_door]:
            if obj_type == ObjectTypes.closed_door:
                grid[front_pos[0], front_pos[1]] = ObjectTypes.open_door
            elif obj_type == ObjectTypes.locked_door and carrying == ObjectTypes.key:
                grid[front_pos[0], front_pos[1]] = ObjectTypes.open_door  # Change to open door
                carrying = None  # Consume the key
            elif obj_type == ObjectTypes.open_door:
                grid[front_pos[0], front_pos[1]] = ObjectTypes.closed_door
    elif action == Actions.done:
        # Done completing the task
        pass

    new_state = MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=tuple(agent_pos),
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=carrying
    )
    return new_state
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Locked Door Toggle**:
   - The original code incorrectly changed a locked door to a closed door when the agent had a key. Now, it correctly changes a locked door to an open door and consumes the key.
   - This change aligns with the expected behavior observed in the real world samples.

2. **Open Door Toggle**:
   - The logic for toggling an open door to a closed door remains the same.

3. **General Structure**:
   - The overall structure of the function remains the same, ensuring that other actions (turn left, turn right, move forward, pick up, drop) continue to work as expected.

This improved `transition_func` should better model the true distribution of next states based on actions and previous states.
