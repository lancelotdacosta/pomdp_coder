The distribution of initial states appears to have the following characteristics:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent can start at various positions within the grid, but it is often located near objects or walls.
2. **Agent Direction**: The agent's direction can be any of the four cardinal directions (right, down, left, up).
3. **Grid Layout**: The grid has a consistent layout with walls, an open space, and specific objects:
   - A key (`7`) is placed in one of the open spaces.
   - A locked door (`6`) is placed in the middle of one of the walls.
   - A goal (`10`) is placed in one of the open spaces.
4. **Carrying Object**: The agent does not start carrying any object.

Based on these observations, we can model the initial state distribution by randomly placing the agent within the open spaces, assigning a random direction, and ensuring the key, locked door, and goal are placed in their respective positions.

Here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
import numpy as np
from typing import Tuple

def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState) -> MinigridState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    grid = empty_state.grid.copy()
    width, height = grid.shape

    # Fixed positions for key, goal, and locked door
    key_pos = (2, 3)
    goal_pos = (8, 3)
    locked_door_pos = (5, 2)

    grid[key_pos] = ObjectTypes.key
    grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal
    grid[locked_door_pos] = ObjectTypes.locked_door

    # Randomly choose an open space for the agent's position
    open_spaces = np.argwhere(grid == ObjectTypes.empty)
    agent_pos = tuple(open_spaces[np.random.choice(len(open_spaces))].tolist())

    # Randomly choose an agent direction
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(list(Direction))

    # Create the initial state
    initial_state = MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return initial_state
```

This function ensures that the key, goal, and locked door are placed in their fixed positions and randomly selects an open space for the agent's initial position and direction. The `empty_state` parameter is expected to have the walls already pre-filled.
