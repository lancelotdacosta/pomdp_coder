Certainly! Let's first understand the distribution of initial states based on the provided samples.

### Analysis of Initial States

1. **Grid Layout**:
   - The grid is always 11x6, with walls surrounding the edges.
   - There is a key at position (3, 2).
   - There is a locked door at position (5, 3).
   - There is a goal at position (9, 3).

2. **Agent Position and Direction**:
   - The agent can start at one of the following positions: (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3).
   - The agent can face either right (0) or up (3).

### Improved Code

To better model the true distribution, we need to ensure that the agent's starting positions and directions are more varied and follow the observed patterns. Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
# type: ignore
from __future__ import annotations

import numpy as np

def initial_func(empty_state: MinigridState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (MinigridState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (MinigridState): the initial state of the environment
    """

    # Define the dimensions of the grid
    width = empty_state.width
    height = empty_state.height

    # Initialize the grid with empty cells
    grid = np.full((width, height), ObjectTypes.empty, dtype=np.int8)

    # Place walls in the grid
    grid[:, 0] = ObjectTypes.wall
    grid[:, -1] = ObjectTypes.wall
    grid[0, :] = ObjectTypes.wall
    grid[-1, :] = ObjectTypes.wall

    # Place the key and goal objects
    key_pos = (3, 2)
    goal_pos = (9, 3)
    grid[key_pos] = ObjectTypes.key
    grid[goal_pos] = ObjectTypes.goal

    # Place the door
    door_pos = (5, 3)
    grid[door_pos] = ObjectTypes.locked_door

    # Define possible agent positions and directions
    possible_agent_positions = [
        (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
    ]
    possible_agent_directions = [0, 3]

    # Randomly select an agent position and direction
    agent_pos = possible_agent_positions[np.random.choice(len(possible_agent_positions))]
    agent_dir = np.random.choice(possible_agent_directions)

    # Create the initial state
    state = MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=agent_pos,
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=None
    )

    return state
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Agent Positions**:
   - The possible agent positions are now more varied to match the observed samples: (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3).

2. **Agent Directions**:
   - The possible agent directions are right (0) and up (3), as observed in the samples.

By making these adjustments, the generated initial states should better reflect the true distribution observed in the real world.
