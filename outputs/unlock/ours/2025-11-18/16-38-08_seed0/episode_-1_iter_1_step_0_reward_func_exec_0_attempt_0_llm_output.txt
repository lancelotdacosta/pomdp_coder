Certainly! Let's analyze the provided scenarios and update the `reward_func` to better model the true distribution.

### Analysis of the Real World Samples

1. **Pickup Key**: The agent should receive a reward of 0.5 when it picks up the key, but only if the key is on the same grid cell as the agent.
2. **Open Locked Door**: The agent should receive a reward of 0.2 when it opens a locked door using a key, but this should only happen if the agent is adjacent to the door and has the key.
3. **Reach Goal**: The agent should receive a reward of 1.0 when it reaches the goal state.
4. **Other Actions**: All other actions should result in a reward of 0.0.

### Improved `reward_func` Function

The main issues in the current implementation are:
- The reward for picking up the key is given even if the key is not on the agent's current grid cell.
- The reward for opening a locked door is given even if the agent is not adjacent to the door or does not have the key.

Let's correct these issues:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (MinigridState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (MinigridState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    
    # Check if the agent has reached the goal state
    goal_pos = next_state.get_type_indices(ObjectTypes.goal)
    agent_pos = next_state.agent_pos
    
    if agent_pos in goal_pos:
        return 1.0, True
    
    # Check if the agent has picked up the key
    if state.carrying is None and next_state.carrying == ObjectTypes.key:
        # Ensure the key was on the agent's current grid cell
        if state.grid[state.agent_pos] == ObjectTypes.key:
            return 0.5, False
    
    # Check if the agent has opened a locked door
    front_pos = next_state.front_pos
    if state.grid[front_pos] == ObjectTypes.locked_door and next_state.grid[front_pos] == ObjectTypes.open_door:
        # Ensure the agent has the key
        if next_state.carrying == ObjectTypes.key:
            return 0.2, False
    
    # Default reward for other actions
    return 0.0, False
```

### Explanation

1. **Goal Reached**: The agent receives a reward of 1.0 if it moves to a grid cell that is a goal.
2. **Key Pickup**: The agent receives a reward of 0.5 if it picks up a key, but only if the key was on the agent's current grid cell in the previous state.
3. **Door Open**: The agent receives a reward of 0.2 if it opens a locked door, but only if the agent has the key and the door is in the front of the agent.
4. **Default**: All other actions result in a reward of 0.0.

This should better align with the real-world samples provided.
