### Explanation of the Distribution of Initial States

The initial states in this environment are characterized by the following:

1. **Grid Structure**: The grid is a fixed structure with walls around the perimeter and specific positions for a key, a locked door, and a goal. The grid size is 11x6.
2. **Key Position**: The key is always placed at position (9, 2).
3. **Door Position**: The locked door is always placed at position (5, 3).
4. **Goal Position**: The goal is always placed at position (8, 3).
5. **Agent Starting Positions and Directions**:
   - The agent can start at one of several predefined positions: (2, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2).
   - The agent can start facing any of the four possible directions: 0 (right), 1 (down), 2 (left), 3 (up).

The initial state is generated by randomly selecting one of these predefined starting positions and directions for the agent. This ensures that the agent starts in a valid position with a random orientation, while the key, door, and goal are always in their fixed positions.
