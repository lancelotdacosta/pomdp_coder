Certainly! Let's analyze the reward conditioned on state, action, and next state transitions in the context of the Minigrid environment and improve the reward function accordingly.

### Analysis:
1. **Goal Reached**:
   - If the agent reaches a goal square, the reward should be positive (e.g., +1).
   - The episode should be marked as done.

2. **Picking Up a Key**:
   - If the agent picks up a key, a small positive reward should be given (e.g., +0.1).

3. **Unlocking a Door**:
   - If the agent unlocks a door using a key, a moderate positive reward should be given (e.g., +0.5).

4. **Hitting a Locked Door Without a Key**:
   - If the agent tries to move forward into a locked door without carrying a key, a negative reward should be given (e.g., -1).

5. **No Change in State**:
   - If the action does not result in any significant change in the state (e.g., moving into a wall), no reward should be given (e.g., 0).

### Improved Reward Function:
Here is the improved `reward_func`:

```python
def reward_func(state: MinigridState, action: Actions, next_state: MinigridState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    def is_at_goal(pos, grid):
        """Check if the agent is at the goal position."""
        goal_positions = state.get_type_indices(ObjectTypes.goal)
        return pos in goal_positions

    def is_door_locked(pos, grid):
        """Check if the cell at position pos is a locked door."""
        return grid[pos[0], pos[1]] == ObjectTypes.locked_door

    def is_key_carried(state):
        """Check if the agent is carrying a key."""
        return state.carrying == ObjectTypes.key

    reward = 0
    done = False

    # Check if the agent has reached the goal
    if is_at_goal(next_state.agent_pos, next_state.grid):
        reward = 1
        done = True

    # Check if the agent tried to move through a locked door without a key
    front_pos = next_state.front_pos
    if action == Actions.forward and is_door_locked(front_pos, state.grid) and not is_key_carried(state):
        reward = -1

    # Check if the agent picked up a key
    if action == Actions.pickup and state.grid[front_pos] == ObjectTypes.key and next_state.carrying == ObjectTypes.key:
        reward = 0.1

    # Check if the agent unlocked a door
    if action == Actions.toggle and state.grid[front_pos] == ObjectTypes.locked_door and is_key_carried(state) and next_state.grid[front_pos] == ObjectTypes.open_door:
        reward = 0.5

    # Check if the agent tried to move into a wall or outside the grid
    if action == Actions.forward and next_state.agent_pos == state.agent_pos:
        reward = -0.1  # Small negative reward for hitting a wall or boundary

    return reward, done
```

### Explanation:
1. **Goal Reached**:
   - The `is_at_goal` function checks if the agent's position in the next state matches any goal position in the grid.
   - If so, a reward of +1 is given, and the episode is marked as done.

2. **Hitting a Locked Door Without a Key**:
   - The `is_door_locked` function checks if the cell in front of the agent is a locked door.
   - If the agent tries to move forward into a locked door without carrying a key, a negative reward of -1 is given.

3. **Picking Up a Key**:
   - The `is_key_carried` function checks if the agent is carrying a key.
   - If the agent performs a pickup action on a key and successfully picks it up, a reward of +0.1 is given.

4. **Unlocking a Door**:
   - If the agent toggles a locked door while carrying a key, and the door becomes an open door, a reward of +0.5 is given.

5. **Hitting a Wall or Boundary**:
   - If the agent tries to move forward but ends up in the same position (indicating hitting a wall or boundary), a small negative reward of -0.1 is given.

This improved reward function should better align with the true distribution of rewards in the Minigrid environment.
