Certainly! Let's break down the reward function and then improve it based on the given observations.

### Reward Function Explanation

1. **Goal Reached**:
   - If the agent reaches the goal square, the reward should be `1.0` and the episode should end (`done = True`).

2. **Key Pickup**:
   - If the agent picks up the key, the reward should be `0.5`. This should only occur if the agent was not carrying anything before and the key was on the agent's current grid cell.

3. **Door Toggle**:
   - If the agent toggles a locked door to an open door, the reward should be `0.2`. This should only occur if the agent is carrying the key.

4. **Other Actions**:
   - For all other actions, the reward should be `0.0` and the episode should not end (`done = False`).

### Issues in the Current Code

The issue with the current code is that it always gives a reward of `0.2` when a locked door is toggled, even if the key has been dropped or lost. This is incorrect because the agent should only be able to toggle the door if it is carrying the key.

### Improved Code

Here is the improved `reward_func` function:

```python
def reward_func(state: MinigridState, action: int, next_state: MinigridState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (MinigridState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (MinigridState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    
    # Check if the agent has reached the goal state
    goal_pos = next_state.get_type_indices(ObjectTypes.goal)
    agent_pos = next_state.agent_pos
    
    if agent_pos in goal_pos:
        return 1.0, True
    
    # Check if the agent has picked up the key
    if state.carrying is None and next_state.carrying == ObjectTypes.key:
        # Ensure the key was on the agent's current grid cell
        if state.grid[state.agent_pos] == ObjectTypes.key:
            return 0.5, False
    
    # Check if the agent has opened a locked door
    front_pos = next_state.front_pos
    if state.grid[front_pos] == ObjectTypes.locked_door and next_state.grid[front_pos] == ObjectTypes.open_door:
        # Ensure the agent has the key
        if next_state.carrying == ObjectTypes.key:
            return 0.2, False
        else:
            # If the agent does not have the key, the door should not open
            return 0.0, False
    
    # Default reward for other actions
    return 0.0, False
```

### Explanation of Improvements

1. **Key Pickup**:
   - The condition `if state.carrying is None and next_state.carrying == ObjectTypes.key` ensures that the agent picks up the key only if it was not carrying anything before and the key is on the agent's current grid cell.

2. **Door Toggle**:
   - The condition `if state.grid[front_pos] == ObjectTypes.locked_door and next_state.grid[front_pos] == ObjectTypes.open_door` ensures that the door toggles from locked to open.
   - The additional condition `if next_state.carrying == ObjectTypes.key` ensures that the agent must be carrying the key to toggle the door. If the agent does not have the key, the reward remains `0.0`.

This improved function should better model the true distribution of rewards in the environment.
