The reward function should accurately reflect the environment's dynamics and reward conditions. Based on the provided samples, it seems the main discrepancy is in the reward for picking up the key. The real world returns a reward of 0 when the agent picks up the key, while your model returns 0.1. This suggests that the reward for picking up the key might be zero in the real environment.

Let's update the `reward_func` to better match the observed behavior:

1. **Goal Reach**: If the agent reaches the goal, the reward is 1.0 and the episode is done.
2. **Key Pickup**: If the agent picks up the key, the reward is 0 (as observed in the real world).
3. **Door Toggle**: If the agent toggles a locked door to open, the reward is 0.1.
4. **Wall or Out of Bounds**: If the agent moves into a wall or out of bounds, the reward is -0.1.
5. **Lava**: If the agent moves into lava, the reward is -1.0 and the episode is done.
6. **Normal Step**: All other actions result in a reward of 0.

Here is the updated `reward_func`:

```python
def reward_func(state: MinigridState, action: int, next_state: MinigridState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (MinigridState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (MinigridState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Check if the episode is done by reaching the goal
    goal_pos = next_state.get_type_indices(ObjectTypes.goal)
    if goal_pos and next_state.agent_pos in goal_pos:
        return 1.0, True

    # Check if the agent picked up the key
    if state.carrying is None and next_state.carrying == ObjectTypes.key:
        return 0.0, False

    # Check if the agent opened a locked door
    front_pos = next_state.front_pos
    if action == Actions.toggle and state.grid[front_pos] == ObjectTypes.locked_door and next_state.grid[front_pos] == ObjectTypes.open_door:
        return 0.1, False

    # Check if the agent moved into a wall or out of bounds
    if next_state.grid[next_state.agent_pos] == ObjectTypes.wall:
        return -0.1, False

    # Check if the agent moved into lava
    if next_state.grid[next_state.agent_pos] == ObjectTypes.lava:
        return -1.0, True

    # Normal step reward
    return 0.0, False
```

This updated function should better match the observed behavior in the real world by setting the reward for picking up the key to 0 and maintaining the other conditions as they were.
