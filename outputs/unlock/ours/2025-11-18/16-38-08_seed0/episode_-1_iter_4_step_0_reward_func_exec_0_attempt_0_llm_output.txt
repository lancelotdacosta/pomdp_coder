Certainly! Let's first explain the reward conditioned on state, action, and next state transition in English:

1. **Goal Reached**: If the agent reaches the goal square, the reward is 1.0, and the episode is done.
2. **Key Pickup**: If the agent picks up the key, the reward is 0.5, and the episode is not done. This should only happen if the key was at the agent's position in the previous state and the agent did not already have it.
3. **Door Open**: If the agent opens a locked door using the key, the reward is 0.2, and the episode is not done. This should only happen if the agent is facing a locked door, has the key, and performs the toggle action.
4. **Default**: For any other actions or transitions, the reward is 0.0, and the episode is not done.

Now, let's improve the `reward_func` function to better model the true distribution:

```python
def reward_func(state: MinigridState, action: int, next_state: MinigridState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (MinigridState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (MinigridState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    
    # Check if the agent has reached the goal state
    goal_pos = next_state.get_type_indices(ObjectTypes.goal)
    agent_pos = next_state.agent_pos
    
    if agent_pos in goal_pos:
        return 1.0, True
    
    # Check if the agent has picked up the key
    if state.carrying is None and next_state.carrying == ObjectTypes.key:
        # Ensure the key was on the agent's current grid cell
        if state.grid[state.agent_pos] == ObjectTypes.key:
            return 0.5, False
    
    # Check if the agent has opened a locked door
    front_pos = next_state.front_pos
    if state.grid[front_pos] == ObjectTypes.locked_door and next_state.grid[front_pos] == ObjectTypes.open_door:
        # Ensure the agent has the key and performed the toggle action
        if next_state.carrying == ObjectTypes.key and action == Actions.toggle:
            return 0.2, False
        else:
            # If the agent does not have the key or did not perform the toggle action, the door should not open
            return 0.0, False
    
    # Default reward for other actions
    return 0.0, False
```

This improved function ensures that:
- The key is only picked up if the agent is on the key's position and did not already have it.
- A locked door is only opened if the agent has the key and performs the toggle action.
- The reward values and done flags are correctly assigned based on the conditions described.
