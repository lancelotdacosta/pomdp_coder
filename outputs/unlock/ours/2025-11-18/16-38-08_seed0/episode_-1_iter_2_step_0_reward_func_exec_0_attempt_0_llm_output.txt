Certainly! Let's first explain the reward conditioned on state, action, next state transition:

### Reward Conditions:
1. **Goal Reached**: If the agent moves to a cell containing the goal, the reward is 1.0, and the episode is marked as done.
2. **Key Picked Up**: If the agent picks up a key (i.e., the carrying state changes from `None` to `key`), the reward is 0.5, and the episode continues.
3. **Locked Door Opened**: If the agent opens a locked door (i.e., a cell changes from `locked_door` to `open_door`), the reward is 0.2, and the episode continues.
4. **Default Reward**: For all other actions, the reward is 0.0, and the episode continues.

### Issues with the Previous Code:
- The previous code did not correctly handle the case where the agent toggles a locked door without having the key.
- The previous code did not account for the scenario where the agent might already be carrying an object other than the key when trying to open a locked door.

### Improved Code:
Here is the improved `reward_func` function that better models the true distribution:

```python
def reward_func(state: MinigridState, action: int, next_state: MinigridState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (MinigridState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (MinigridState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    
    # Check if the agent has reached the goal state
    goal_pos = next_state.get_type_indices(ObjectTypes.goal)
    agent_pos = next_state.agent_pos
    
    if agent_pos in goal_pos:
        return 1.0, True
    
    # Check if the agent has picked up the key
    if state.carrying is None and next_state.carrying == ObjectTypes.key:
        # Ensure the key was on the agent's current grid cell
        if state.grid[state.agent_pos] == ObjectTypes.key:
            return 0.5, False
    
    # Check if the agent has opened a locked door
    front_pos = next_state.front_pos
    if state.grid[front_pos] == ObjectTypes.locked_door and next_state.grid[front_pos] == ObjectTypes.open_door:
        # Ensure the agent has the key
        if next_state.carrying == ObjectTypes.key:
            return 0.2, False
        else:
            # If the agent does not have the key, the door should not open
            return 0.0, False
    
    # Default reward for other actions
    return 0.0, False
```

### Explanation of Improvements:
1. **Goal Reached**: The condition remains the same.
2. **Key Picked Up**: The condition remains the same.
3. **Locked Door Opened**:
   - The code now checks if the agent has the key before allowing the door to open.
   - If the agent does not have the key, the door should not open, and the reward is 0.0.
4. **Default Reward**: The default reward of 0.0 is applied to all other actions.

This should better align with the true distribution of rewards in the environment.
