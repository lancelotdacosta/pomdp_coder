To better model the true distribution of next states conditioned on actions and previous states, we need to ensure that our `transition_func` function accurately captures all possible transitions and their outcomes. Here are the key points to address:

1. **Forward Movement**: The agent should be able to move forward if the cell in front is either empty or an open door.
2. **Toggle Action**: The agent should be able to toggle doors (closed to open, open to closed) and unlock locked doors with a key.
3. **Pickup and Drop Actions**: The agent should be able to pick up and drop objects correctly, ensuring the grid and carrying state are updated appropriately.
4. **Agent Carrying Key**: If the agent is carrying a key, it should be able to unlock a locked door and then drop the key.

Here is the improved `transition_func` function:

```python
def transition_func(state, action):
    """
    Args:
        state (MinigridState): the state of the environment 
        action (int): action to be taken in state `state`
    Returns:
        new_state (MinigridState): the new state of the environment
    """
    grid = state.grid.copy()
    agent_pos = np.array(state.agent_pos)
    agent_dir = state.agent_dir
    carrying = state.carrying

    def move_agent():
        nonlocal agent_pos
        next_pos = agent_pos + DIR_TO_VEC[agent_dir]
        if 0 <= next_pos[0] < state.width and 0 <= next_pos[1] < state.height:
            if grid[tuple(next_pos)] in [ObjectTypes.empty, ObjectTypes.open_door]:
                agent_pos = next_pos

    def turn_left():
        nonlocal agent_dir
        agent_dir = (agent_dir - 1) % 4

    def turn_right():
        nonlocal agent_dir
        agent_dir = (agent_dir + 1) % 4

    def toggle():
        nonlocal carrying, grid
        front_pos = np.array(agent_pos) + DIR_TO_VEC[agent_dir]
        if 0 <= front_pos[0] < state.width and 0 <= front_pos[1] < state.height:
            obj_type = grid[tuple(front_pos)]
            if obj_type == ObjectTypes.closed_door:
                grid[tuple(front_pos)] = ObjectTypes.open_door
            elif obj_type == ObjectTypes.open_door:
                grid[tuple(front_pos)] = ObjectTypes.closed_door
            elif obj_type == ObjectTypes.locked_door and carrying == ObjectTypes.key:
                grid[tuple(front_pos)] = ObjectTypes.open_door
                carrying = None

    def pickup():
        nonlocal carrying, grid
        front_pos = np.array(agent_pos) + DIR_TO_VEC[agent_dir]
        if 0 <= front_pos[0] < state.width and 0 <= front_pos[1] < state.height:
            obj_type = grid[tuple(front_pos)]
            if (obj_type in [ObjectTypes.key, ObjectTypes.ball, ObjectTypes.box]) and carrying is None:
                carrying = obj_type
                grid[tuple(front_pos)] = ObjectTypes.empty

    def drop():
        nonlocal carrying, grid
        front_pos = np.array(agent_pos) + DIR_TO_VEC[agent_dir]
        if 0 <= front_pos[0] < state.width and 0 <= front_pos[1] < state.height:
            if grid[tuple(front_pos)] == ObjectTypes.empty and carrying is not None:
                grid[tuple(front_pos)] = carrying
                carrying = None

    # Apply the action
    if action == Actions.left:
        turn_left()
    elif action == Actions.right:
        turn_right()
    elif action == Actions.forward:
        move_agent()
    elif action == Actions.pickup:
        pickup()
    elif action == Actions.drop:
        drop()
    elif action == Actions.toggle:
        toggle()
    elif action == Actions.done:
        pass  # No change in the environment

    # Create the new state
    new_state = MinigridState(
        grid=grid,
        agent_pos=tuple(agent_pos),
        agent_dir=agent_dir,
        carrying=carrying
    )

    return new_state
```

### Explanation of Improvements:
1. **Forward Movement**: The `move_agent` function now checks if the cell in front is either empty or an open door before moving the agent.
2. **Toggle Action**: The `toggle` function correctly toggles doors and unlocks locked doors with a key, ensuring the key is dropped after unlocking.
3. **Pickup and Drop Actions**: The `pickup` and `drop` functions ensure that the agent can pick up and drop objects correctly, updating the grid and carrying state accordingly.

This improved `transition_func` should more accurately model the true distribution of next states based on the given actions and previous states.
