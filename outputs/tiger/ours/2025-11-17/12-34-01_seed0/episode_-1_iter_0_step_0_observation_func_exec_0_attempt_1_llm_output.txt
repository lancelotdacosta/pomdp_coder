The error you're encountering is due to an incorrect syntax in the `TigerObservationEnum` class definition. In Python, when defining enum values, you should not use commas to separate the values and their names. Instead, each value should be defined on a separate line.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import copy
import enum
import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

from uncertain_worms.structs import (
    Environment,
    Heuristic,
    InitialModel,
    Observation,
    ObservationModel,
    RewardModel,
    State,
    TransitionModel,
)


# --------------------------- Enums & Dataclasses -----------------------------#
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0
    HEAR_RIGHT = 1
    NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int  # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def observation_func(state: TigerState, action: int, empty_obs: TigerObservation) -> TigerObservation:
    """
    Represents the non-centered field of view of the agent.

    The observation represents the agent's relative view of the world. 

    The agent is NOT in the center of the observation grid.

    Observation grids are always square-sizes (i.e. 3x3, 5x5, 7x7).

    The width and height of the observation grid are called view size.

    The agent is ALWAYS at obs.image[view_size // 2, view_size - 1] in the observation `image`

    Your may make use of the state.get_field_of_view helper function.

    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the previous action that was taken
        empty_obs (TigerObservation): an empty observation that needs to be filled and returned
    Returns:
        obs (TigerObservation): observation of the agent
    """
    if action != TigerActions.LISTEN.value:
        return TigerObservation(obs=TigerObservationEnum.NONE.value)
    
    if state.tiger_location == 1:  # Tiger is on the right
        obs = 1 if random.random() < 0.8 else 0
    else:  # Tiger is on the left
        obs = 0 if random.random() < 0.8 else 1
    
    return TigerObservation(obs=obs)
```

### Explanation of the Changes

1. **Corrected `TigerObservationEnum` Definition**:
   - Each enum value is defined on a separate line without commas.

2. **Ensured Correct Syntax**:
   - The rest of the code remains unchanged, ensuring that the observations are generated based on the tiger's location and the action taken.

This should resolve the `SyntaxError` you encountered and allow the code to compile and run correctly.
