Based on the provided samples, it appears that the tiger location is more likely to be on the right side (RIGHT). However, to avoid overfitting, we should model the distribution as close to 50/50 with a slight bias towards the right side.

Here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import copy
import enum
import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

from uncertain_worms.structs import (
    Environment,
    Heuristic,
    InitialModel,
    Observation,
    ObservationModel,
    RewardModel,
    State,
    TransitionModel,
)


# --------------------------- Enums & Dataclasses -----------------------------#
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0, HEAR_RIGHT = 1, NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def initial_func(empty_state: TigerState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (TigerState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (TigerState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define the probabilities for the tiger location
    probabilities = [0.4, 0.6]  # Slightly biased towards the right side
    
    # Sample the tiger location based on the defined probabilities
    tiger_location = random.choices([0, 1], probabilities)[0]
    
    # Create and return the initial state
    return TigerState(tiger_location=tiger_location)
```

This implementation ensures that the initial state is sampled with a slight bias towards the tiger being on the right side, while still maintaining a reasonable distribution to avoid overfitting to the specific samples provided.
