#define system
You are a robot exploring its environment. 

Environment Description: 
Goal Description: 

Your goal is to model the the distribution of next states conditioned on actions and previous states. 
You need to implement the python code to model the world, as seen in the provided experiences. 
Please follow the template to implement the code. 
The code needs to be directly runnable (state, action) and return a sample (next_state). 


Below are a few samples from the environment distribution. These are only samples from a larger distribution that your should model.

Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 0
Output TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 0
Output TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)




Here is the template for the transition_func function. Please implement
the reward function following the template. The code needs to be directly
runnable.

Explain what you believe is the the distribution of next states conditioned on actions and previous states in english.
Additionally, please implement code to model the logic of the world. Please implement the 
code following the template. Only output the definition for ‘ transition_func ‘. 
You must implement the ‘ transition_func ‘ function.
Create any helper function inside the scope of ‘ transition_func ‘. 
Do not create any helper function outside the scope of ‘ transition_func ‘.
Do not output examples usage. 
Do not create any new classes.
Do not rewrite existing classes. 
Do not import any new modules from anywhere.
Do not overfit to the specific samples.
Put the ‘ transition_func ‘ function in a python code block.
