The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `LEFT` and `RIGHT` are not defined in the scope of the `reward_func` function. These should be constants or enums representing the locations of the tiger. Since `TigerState` uses integers to represent the tiger's location, we can use 0 for `LEFT` and 1 for `RIGHT`.

Here's the corrected `reward_func`:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (TigerState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    LEFT = 0
    RIGHT = 1

    # Define the reward and done based on the state, action, and next state
    if action == TigerActions.OPEN_LEFT:
        if state.tiger_location == LEFT:
            reward = -1.0  # Opening left door when tiger is behind it
        else:
            reward = 1.0  # Opening left door when tiger is behind right door
        done = True  # Episode ends after opening a door
    elif action == TigerActions.OPEN_RIGHT:
        if state.tiger_location == RIGHT:
            reward = -1.0  # Opening right door when tiger is behind it
        else:
            reward = 1.0  # Opening right door when tiger is behind left door
        done = True  # Episode ends after opening a door
    elif action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        reward = 0.0  # No reward for listening
        done = False  # Episode continues after listening

    return reward, done
```

### Explanation
- **Constants `LEFT` and `RIGHT`**:
  - These constants are defined within the `reward_func` to represent the locations of the tiger.
- **Action Conditions**:
  - **Opening the Left Door (Action 0)**: 
    - If the tiger is behind the left door (`state.tiger_location == LEFT`), the agent receives a reward of -1.0.
    - Otherwise, the agent receives a reward of 1.0.
    - The episode ends (`done = True`).
  - **Opening the Right Door (Action 1)**:
    - If the tiger is behind the right door (`state.tiger_location == RIGHT`), the agent receives a reward of -1.0.
    - Otherwise, the agent receives a reward of 1.0.
    - The episode ends (`done = True`).
  - **Listening (Action 2)**:
    - The agent receives no reward (0.0).
    - The episode continues (`done = False`).

This should resolve the `NameError` and correctly implement the reward function based on the provided samples.
