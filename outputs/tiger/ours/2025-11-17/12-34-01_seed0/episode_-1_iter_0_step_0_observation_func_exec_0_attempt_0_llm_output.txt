Based on the provided samples, it seems that the observations are probabilistic and depend on the state (tiger location) and the action taken. Specifically:

- When the tiger is behind the right door (`tiger_location=1`), the agent has a higher probability of hearing the tiger on the right side (`obs=1`) and a lower probability of hearing it on the left side (`obs=0`).
- When the tiger is behind the left door (`tiger_location=0`), the agent has a higher probability of hearing the tiger on the left side (`obs=0`) and a lower probability of hearing it on the right side (`obs=1`).
- The `LISTEN` action (action=2) is the only action that results in an observation. The other actions (`OPEN_LEFT` and `OPEN_RIGHT`) do not provide an observation.

Given this understanding, the distribution of observations can be modeled as follows:

- If the tiger is on the right (`tiger_location=1`):
  - Probability of hearing the tiger on the right (`obs=1`): 0.8
  - Probability of hearing the tiger on the left (`obs=0`): 0.2

- If the tiger is on the left (`tiger_location=0`):
  - Probability of hearing the tiger on the left (`obs=0`): 0.8
  - Probability of hearing the tiger on the right (`obs=1`): 0.2

Here is the implementation of the `observation_func` function based on this distribution:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import copy
import enum
import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

from uncertain_worms.structs import (
    Environment,
    Heuristic,
    InitialModel,
    Observation,
    ObservationModel,
    RewardModel,
    State,
    TransitionModel,
)


# --------------------------- Enums & Dataclasses -----------------------------#
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0, HEAR_RIGHT = 1, NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def observation_func(state: TigerState, action: int, empty_obs: TigerObservation) -> TigerObservation:
    """
    Represents the non-centered field of view of the agent.

    The observation represents the agent's relative view of the world. 

    The agent is NOT in the center of the observation grid.

    Observation grids are always square-sizes (i.e. 3x3, 5x5, 7x7).

    The width and height of the observation grid are called view size.

    The agent is ALWAYS at obs.image[view_size // 2, view_size - 1] in the observation `image`

    Your may make use of the state.get_field_of_view helper function.

    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the previous action that was taken
        empty_obs (TigerObservation): an empty observation that needs to be filled and returned
    Returns:
        obs (TigerObservation): observation of the agent
    """
    if action != TigerActions.LISTEN.value:
        return TigerObservation(obs=TigerObservationEnum.NONE.value)
    
    if state.tiger_location == 1:  # Tiger is on the right
        obs = 1 if random.random() < 0.8 else 0
    else:  # Tiger is on the left
        obs = 0 if random.random() < 0.8 else 1
    
    return TigerObservation(obs=obs)
```

This implementation ensures that the observations are probabilistic and depend on the tiger's location and the action taken by the agent.
