### Explanation
- **Opening the Left Door (Action 0)**:
  - If the tiger is behind the left door, the agent receives a reward of -1.0 and the episode ends.
  - If the tiger is behind the right door, the agent receives a reward of 1.0 and the episode ends.
- **Opening the Right Door (Action 1)**:
  - If the tiger is behind the right door, the agent receives a reward of -1.0 and the episode ends.
  - If the tiger is behind the left door, the agent receives a reward of 1.0 and the episode ends.
- **Listening (Action 2)**:
  - The agent receives no reward (0.0) for listening.
  - The episode continues after listening.

This logic ensures that the agent is penalized for making a wrong decision (opening the door with the tiger) and rewarded for making the correct decision (opening the door without the tiger). Listening does not affect the state or end the episode but provides information to the agent.
