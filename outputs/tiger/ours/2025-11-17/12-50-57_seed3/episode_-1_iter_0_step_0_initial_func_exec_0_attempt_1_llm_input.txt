#define system
You are a robot exploring its environment. 

Environment Description: 
Goal Description: 

Your goal is to model the the distribution of initial states . 
You need to implement the python code to model the world, as seen in the provided experiences. 
Please follow the template to implement the code. 
The code needs to be directly runnable an empty state with the walls of the grid pre-filled and return a sample initial state. 


Below are a few samples from the environment distribution. These are only samples from a larger distribution that your should model.

Output TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)


Output TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)


Output TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)


Output TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)


Output TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)




Here is the template for the initial_func function. Please implement
the reward function following the template. The code needs to be directly
runnable.

Explain what you believe is the the distribution of initial states  in english.
Additionally, please implement code to model the logic of the world. Please implement the 
code following the template. Only output the definition for ‘ initial_func ‘. 
You must implement the ‘ initial_func ‘ function.
Create any helper function inside the scope of ‘ initial_func ‘. 
Do not create any helper function outside the scope of ‘ initial_func ‘.
Do not output examples usage. 
Do not create any new classes.
Do not rewrite existing classes. 
Do not import any new modules from anywhere.
Do not overfit to the specific samples.
Put the ‘ initial_func ‘ function in a python code block.

Based on the provided samples, it appears that the distribution of initial states is biased towards the tiger being located on the RIGHT side (1) more frequently than on the LEFT side (0). However, to avoid overfitting, we should model a distribution that reflects this bias but also allows for some variability.

Let's assume the probability of the tiger being on the RIGHT side is 60% and on the LEFT side is 40%. This distribution is a reasonable approximation given the provided samples.

Here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import copy
import enum
import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

from uncertain_worms.structs import (
    Environment,
    Heuristic,
    InitialModel,
    Observation,
    ObservationModel,
    RewardModel,
    State,
    TransitionModel,
)

# --------------------------- Enums & Dataclasses -----------------------------#
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0, HEAR_RIGHT = 1, NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def initial_func(empty_state: TigerState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (TigerState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (TigerState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define the probability distribution for the initial states
    probabilities = [0.4, 0.6]  # Probability of LEFT and RIGHT respectively

    # Sample the initial state based on the defined probabilities
    tiger_location = random.choices([0, 1], weights=probabilities, k=1)[0]

    # Create the initial state with the sampled tiger location
    state = copy.copy(empty_state)
    state.tiger_location = tiger_location

    return state
```

This function uses a weighted random choice to sample the initial state of the tiger's location, reflecting the observed bias in the provided samples while maintaining a degree of variability.
