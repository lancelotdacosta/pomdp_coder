Certainly! Let's analyze the reward function based on the provided observations and correct the discrepancies.

### Reward Function Analysis

1. **Listening Action (Action 2)**:
   - No immediate reward (`0.0`).
   - Episode does not end (`done = False`).

2. **Opening Left Door (Action 0)**:
   - If the tiger is behind the left door (`state.tiger_location == 0`), the reward is `-100` and the episode ends (`done = True`).
   - If the tiger is behind the right door (`state.tiger_location == 1`), the reward is either `1.0` or `10.0` based on the next state:
     - If `next_state.tiger_location == 0`, the reward is `1.0`.
     - If `next_state.tiger_location == 1`, the reward is `10.0`.

3. **Opening Right Door (Action 1)**:
   - If the tiger is behind the right door (`state.tiger_location == 1`), the reward is `-100` and the episode ends (`done = True`).
   - If the tiger is behind the left door (`state.tiger_location == 0`), the reward is either `1.0` or `10.0` based on the next state:
     - If `next_state.tiger_location == 0`, the reward is `10.0`.
     - If `next_state.tiger_location == 1`, the reward is `1.0`.

### Corrected Reward Function

The main issue in the original code was the incorrect assignment of rewards when the agent opened a door and the tiger was not behind it. The reward should be `1.0` if the next state is the same as the current state, and `10.0` if the next state is different.

Here is the corrected `reward_func` function:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (TigerState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Define the reward based on the action and the state transition
    if action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        # Listening action gives no immediate reward and does not end the episode
        reward = 0.0
        done = False
    elif action == TigerActions.OPEN_LEFT:
        # If the agent opens the left door and the tiger is behind it, the reward is -100
        if state.tiger_location == 0:
            reward = -100
            done = True
        # If the tiger is behind the right door, the reward is +1.0 or +10.0 based on next_state
        else:
            if next_state.tiger_location == state.tiger_location:
                reward = 1.0
            else:
                reward = 10.0
            done = True
    elif action == TigerActions.OPEN_RIGHT:
        # If the agent opens the right door and the tiger is behind it, the reward is -100
        if state.tiger_location == 1:
            reward = -100
            done = True
        # If the tiger is behind the left door, the reward is +1.0 or +10.0 based on next_state
        else:
            if next_state.tiger_location == state.tiger_location:
                reward = 10.0
            else:
                reward = 1.0
            done = True
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid action: {action}")

    return reward, done
```

This corrected function should now align with the observed distribution from the real world.
