Based on the provided samples, it appears that the environment has the following behavior:

- If the action is `LISTEN` (action=2), the tiger's location does not change.
- If the action is `OPEN_LEFT` (action=0) or `OPEN_RIGHT` (action=1), the tiger's location also does not change.

Given this understanding, the transition function can be implemented as follows:

```python
def transition_func(state, action):
    """
    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment 
        action (int): action to be taken in state `state`
    Returns:
        new_state (TigerState): the new state of the environment
    """
    # Create a copy of the current state to avoid modifying the original state
    new_state = copy.deepcopy(state)
    
    # The tiger's location does not change regardless of the action
    return new_state
```

This implementation ensures that the tiger's location remains unchanged for all actions, which is consistent with the provided samples.
