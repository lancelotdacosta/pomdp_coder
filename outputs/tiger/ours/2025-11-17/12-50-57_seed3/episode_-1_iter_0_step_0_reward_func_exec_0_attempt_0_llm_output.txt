### Explanation in English

The reward function is conditioned on the state, action, and next state transition as follows:

1. **Listening Action (LISTEN)**:
   - The agent listens to hear which side the tiger is on.
   - There is no immediate reward for this action.
   - The episode does not end.

2. **Opening the Left Door (OPEN_LEFT)**:
   - If the tiger is behind the left door, the agent receives a large negative reward (-100) and the episode ends.
   - If the tiger is behind the right door, the agent receives a positive reward (+10) and the episode ends.

3. **Opening the Right Door (OPEN_RIGHT)**:
   - If the tiger is behind the right door, the agent receives a large negative reward (-100) and the episode ends.
   - If the tiger is behind the left door, the agent receives a positive reward (+10) and the episode ends.

This reward structure encourages the agent to listen and gather information before making a high-stakes decision to open a door.
