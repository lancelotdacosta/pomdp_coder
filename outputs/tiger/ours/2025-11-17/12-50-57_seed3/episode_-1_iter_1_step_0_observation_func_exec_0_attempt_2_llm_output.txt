The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the `enum` module is not imported. You need to import the `enum` module to use `enum.IntEnum`.

Here is the corrected implementation of the `observation_func` function with the necessary import:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

from uncertain_worms.structs import (
    Environment,
    Heuristic,
    InitialModel,
    Observation,
    ObservationModel,
    RewardModel,
    State,
    TransitionModel,
)

import enum  # Import the enum module


# --------------------------- Enums & Dataclasses -----------------------------#
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0
    HEAR_RIGHT = 1
    NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int  # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def observation_func(state: TigerState, action: int, empty_obs: TigerObservation) -> TigerObservation:
    """
    Represents the non-centered field of view of the agent.

    The observation represents the agent's relative view of the world. 

    The agent is NOT in the center of the observation grid.

    Observation grids are always square-sizes (i.e. 3x3, 5x5, 7x7).

    The width and height of the observation grid are called view size.

    The agent is ALWAYS at obs.image[view_size // 2, view_size - 1] in the observation `image`

    Your may make use of the state.get_field_of_view helper function.

    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the previous action that was taken
        empty_obs (TigerObservation): an empty observation that needs to be filled and returned
    Returns:
        obs (TigerObservation): observation of the agent
    """
    def generate_observation(tiger_location: int, action: int) -> int:
        if action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
            if tiger_location == TigerState(tiger_location=0).tiger_location:
                return random.choices([0, 1, 2], weights=[0.85, 0.05, 0.1])[0]
            elif tiger_location == TigerState(tiger_location=1).tiger_location:
                return random.choices([0, 1, 2], weights=[0.05, 0.85, 0.1])[0]
        else:
            if tiger_location == TigerState(tiger_location=0).tiger_location:
                return random.choices([0, 1, 2], weights=[0.6, 0.2, 0.2])[0]
            elif tiger_location == TigerState(tiger_location=1).tiger_location:
                return random.choices([0, 1, 2], weights=[0.2, 0.6, 0.2])[0]

    obs = generate_observation(state.tiger_location, action)
    return TigerObservation(obs=obs)
```

In this version, the `enum` module is imported, which should resolve the `NameError` you encountered. The rest of the implementation remains the same.
