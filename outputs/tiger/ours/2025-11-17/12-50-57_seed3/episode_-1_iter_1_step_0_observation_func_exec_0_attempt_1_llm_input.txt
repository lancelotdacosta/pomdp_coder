#define system
You are a robot exploring its environment. 

Environment Description: 
Goal Description: 

Your goal is to model the the distribution of observations conditioned on a state. 
You need to implement the python code to model the world, as seen in the provided experiences. 
Please follow the template to implement the code. 
The code needs to be directly runnable (state) and return a sample (observation). 


Below are a few samples from the environment distribution. These are only samples from a larger distribution that your should model.

Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=0)


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=1)


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 0
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=2)


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=0)


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=0)




Here is the template for the observation_func function. Please implement
the reward function following the template. The code needs to be directly
runnable.

Explain what you believe is the the distribution of observations conditioned on a state in english.
Additionally, please implement code to model the logic of the world. Please implement the 
code following the template. Only output the definition for ‘ observation_func ‘. 
You must implement the ‘ observation_func ‘ function.
Create any helper function inside the scope of ‘ observation_func ‘. 
Do not create any helper function outside the scope of ‘ observation_func ‘.
Do not output examples usage. 
Do not create any new classes.
Do not rewrite existing classes. 
Do not import any new modules from anywhere.
Do not overfit to the specific samples.
Put the ‘ observation_func ‘ function in a python code block.
#define assistant
Based on the provided samples, it appears that the observations are generated according to the following distribution:

- If the tiger is behind the left door (`tiger_location = LEFT`):
  - The agent hears the tiger on the left (`obs = 0`) with some probability.
  - The agent hears the tiger on the right (`obs = 1`) with some probability.
  - The agent hears nothing (`obs = 2`) with some probability.

- If the tiger is behind the right door (`tiger_location = RIGHT`):
  - The agent hears the tiger on the left (`obs = 0`) with some probability.
  - The agent hears the tiger on the right (`obs = 1`) with some probability.
  - The agent hears nothing (`obs = 2`) with some probability.

The action taken by the agent does not seem to affect the observation directly, but it might influence the probabilities. For simplicity, we will assume that the action `LISTEN` (action = 2) provides a better chance of hearing the correct side where the tiger is, while actions `OPEN_LEFT` (action = 0) and `OPEN_RIGHT` (action = 1) might still give some noise in the observations.

Here is the implementation of the `observation_func` function:

```

This function models the observation distribution based on the provided samples and the assumption that the `LISTEN` action provides more accurate observations compared to the other actions. The probabilities are chosen to reflect this behavior, with higher weights for the correct observation when listening and some noise for other actions.
