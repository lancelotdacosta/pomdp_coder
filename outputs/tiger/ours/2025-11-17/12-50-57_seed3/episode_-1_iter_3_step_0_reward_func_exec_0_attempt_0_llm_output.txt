Based on the provided information and the inconsistencies between the real-world samples and the generated model, it seems there is a misunderstanding in the reward calculation for certain state transitions. Specifically, the inconsistency lies in the reward values for opening the door when the tiger is behind the other door.

### Explanation:
- **State**: The location of the tiger (`tiger_location`).
- **Action**: The action taken by the agent (`OPEN_LEFT`, `OPEN_RIGHT`, or `LISTEN`).
- **Next State**: The state after the action is taken, which should ideally be the same as the current state since the tiger's location does not change due to the agent's actions.

### Reward Calculation:
- ** Listening Action (`LISTEN`)**: No immediate reward, and the episode continues.
- ** Opening Left Door (`OPEN_LEFT`)**:
  - If the tiger is behind the left door: Reward = -100, Episode ends.
  - If the tiger is behind the right door: Reward = +1.0, Episode ends.
- ** Opening Right Door (`OPEN_RIGHT`)**:
  - If the tiger is behind the right door: Reward = -100, Episode ends.
  - If the tiger is behind the left door: Reward = +1.0, Episode ends.

### Correction:
The current code incorrectly assigns a higher reward of 10.0 in some cases. The correct reward should be 1.0 when the agent opens the door that does not have the tiger behind it.

Here is the corrected `reward_func` function:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (TigerState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Define the reward based on the action and the state transition
    if action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        # Listening action gives no immediate reward and does not end the episode
        reward = 0.0
        done = False
    elif action == TigerActions.OPEN_LEFT:
        # If the agent opens the left door and the tiger is behind it, the reward is -100
        if state.tiger_location == 0:
            reward = -100
            done = True
        # If the tiger is behind the right door, the reward is +1.0
        else:
            reward = 1.0
            done = True
    elif action == TigerActions.OPEN_RIGHT:
        # If the agent opens the right door and the tiger is behind it, the reward is -100
        if state.tiger_location == 1:
            reward = -100
            done = True
        # If the tiger is behind the left door, the reward is +1.0
        else:
            reward = 1.0
            done = True
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid action: {action}")

    return reward, done
```

This corrected function should now accurately model the reward based on the state, action, and next state transitions, matching the real-world samples provided.
