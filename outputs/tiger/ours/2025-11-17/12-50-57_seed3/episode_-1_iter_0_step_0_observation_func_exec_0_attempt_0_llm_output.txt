Certainly! Based on the provided samples, it seems that the observation distribution is influenced by both the tiger's location and the action taken by the agent. Specifically:

- When the agent listens (`action = 2`), the agent mostly hears the correct side where the tiger is (LEFT or RIGHT). However, there is a small chance that the agent might hear nothing.
- When the agent takes any other action (`action = 0` or `action = 1`), the observation tends to be "none" (i.e., no useful information).

Let's implement the `observation_func` function based on this understanding.

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import copy
import enum
import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

from uncertain_worms.structs import (
    Environment,
    Heuristic,
    InitialModel,
    Observation,
    ObservationModel,
    RewardModel,
    State,
    TransitionModel,
)


# --------------------------- Enums & Dataclasses -----------------------------#
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0
    HEAR_RIGHT = 1
    NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def observation_func(state, action, empty_obs):
    """
    Represents the non-centered field of view of the agent.

    The observation represents the agent's relative view of the world. 

    The agent is NOT in the center of the observation grid.

    Observation grids are always square-sizes (i.e. 3x3, 5x5, 7x7).

    The width and height of the observation grid are called view size.

    The agent is ALWAYS at obs.image[view_size // 2, view_size - 1] in the observation `image`

    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the previous action that was taken
        empty_obs (TigerObservation): an empty observation that needs to be filled and returned
    Returns:
        obs (TigerObservation): observation of the agent
    """
    if action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        # When the agent listens, it mostly hears the correct side but can sometimes hear nothing
        if state.tiger_location == TigerState(tiger_location=0) and random.random() < 0.85:
            return TigerObservation(obs=TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_LEFT)
        elif state.tiger_location == TigerState(tiger_location=1) and random.random() < 0.85:
            return TigerObservation(obs=TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_RIGHT)
        else:
            return TigerObservation(obs=TigerObservationEnum.NONE)
    else:
        # When the agent takes any other action, the observation is usually "none"
        return TigerObservation(obs=TigerObservationEnum.NONE)
```

This implementation models the observation distribution based on the provided samples. The `observation_func` function returns an observation that is mostly correct when the agent listens, but there is a small chance of hearing nothing. For other actions, the observation is always "none".
