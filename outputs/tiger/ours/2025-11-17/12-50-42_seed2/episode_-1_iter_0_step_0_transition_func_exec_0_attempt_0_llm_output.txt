### Explanation

The transition function models the distribution of next states conditioned on actions and previous states. Here's how it works:

1. **Tiger Location Change**:
   - **Opening a Door**: When the agent chooses to open a door (either `OPEN_LEFT` or `OPEN_RIGHT`), the tiger's location is reset to a random position (either `LEFT` or `RIGHT`).
   - **Listening**: When the agent listens (`LISTEN`), the tiger's location remains unchanged.

2. **Observation**:
   - The observation logic is not part of the transition function, so we focus solely on the state transition.
   - The tiger's location does not change with the `LISTEN` action, but it changes to a random location when either door is opened.

This function ensures that the environment's dynamics are accurately modeled based on the provided samples and the typical behavior of the Tiger problem.
