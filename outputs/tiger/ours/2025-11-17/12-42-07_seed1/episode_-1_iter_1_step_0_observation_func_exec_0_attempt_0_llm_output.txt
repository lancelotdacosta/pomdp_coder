Based on the provided samples, it appears that the observation distribution conditioned on the state has some inherent noise or uncertainty, especially when the agent listens. Specifically:

- When the tiger is on the left (tiger_location = 0) and the agent listens (action = 2), the agent can hear the tiger correctly (HEAR_LEFT), hear nothing (NONE), or incorrectly hear the tiger on the right (HEAR_RIGHT).
- When the tiger is on the right (tiger_location = 1) and the agent listens (action = 2), the agent can hear the tiger correctly (HEAR_RIGHT), hear nothing (NONE), or incorrectly hear the tiger on the left (HEAR_LEFT).

To better model this distribution, we need to adjust the probabilities of each observation based on the state. Here's an improved version of the `observation_func` function:

```python
def observation_func(state: TigerState, action: int, empty_obs: TigerObservation) -> TigerObservation:
    """
    Represents the non-centered field of view of the agent.

    The observation represents the agent's relative view of the world. 

    The agent is NOT in the center of the observation grid.

    Observation grids are always square-sizes (i.e. 3x3, 5x5, 7x7).

    The width and height of the observation grid are called view size.

    The agent is ALWAYS at obs.image[view_size // 2, view_size - 1] in the observation `image`

    Your may make use of the state.get_field_of_view helper function.

    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the previous action that was taken
        empty_obs (TigerObservation): an empty observation that needs to be filled and returned
    Returns:
        obs (TigerObservation): observation of the agent
    """
    if action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        # Define probabilities for each observation based on the state
        if state.tiger_location == 0:  # LEFT
            obs = random.choices(
                [TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_LEFT, TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_RIGHT, TigerObservationEnum.NONE],
                weights=[0.8, 0.1, 0.1]
            )[0]
        elif state.tiger_location == 1:  # RIGHT
            obs = random.choices(
                [TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_RIGHT, TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_LEFT, TigerObservationEnum.NONE],
                weights=[0.8, 0.1, 0.1]
            )[0]
    else:
        # When opening a door, the agent does not hear anything
        obs = TigerObservationEnum.NONE

    return TigerObservation(obs=obs.value)
```

### Explanation of the Distribution:
- **When the tiger is on the left (tiger_location = 0) and the agent listens:**
  - The agent has an 80% chance of correctly hearing the tiger on the left (HEAR_LEFT).
  - The agent has a 10% chance of incorrectly hearing the tiger on the right (HEAR_RIGHT).
  - The agent has a 10% chance of hearing nothing (NONE).

- **When the tiger is on the right (tiger_location = 1) and the agent listens:**
  - The agent has an 80% chance of correctly hearing the tiger on the right (HEAR_RIGHT).
  - The agent has a 10% chance of incorrectly hearing the tiger on the left (HEAR_LEFT).
  - The agent has a 10% chance of hearing nothing (NONE).

- **When the agent opens a door (action = OPEN_LEFT or action = OPEN_RIGHT):**
  - The agent always hears nothing (NONE).

This distribution should better match the observed real-world behavior and account for the inherent uncertainty in the observations.
