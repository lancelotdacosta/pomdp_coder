Based on the provided samples, it appears that the distribution of observations is influenced by both the state (tiger location) and the action taken by the agent. Specifically:

1. **Action 2 (LISTEN)**:
   - If the tiger is on the RIGHT, the agent is more likely to hear the tiger on the RIGHT (observation 1).
   - If the tiger is on the LEFT, the agent is more likely to hear the tiger on the LEFT (observation 0).

2. **Action 0 (OPEN_LEFT) or Action 1 (OPEN_RIGHT)**:
   - The agent does not hear anything (observation 2) when opening a door (regardless of the tiger's location).

Given this understanding, we can model the observation function accordingly. Here is the implementation of the `observation_func`:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import copy
import enum
import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

from uncertain_worms.structs import (
    Environment,
    Heuristic,
    InitialModel,
    Observation,
    ObservationModel,
    RewardModel,
    State,
    TransitionModel,
)


# --------------------------- Enums & Dataclasses -----------------------------#
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0, HEAR_RIGHT = 1, NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def observation_func(state: TigerState, action: int, empty_obs: TigerObservation) -> TigerObservation:
    """
    Represents the non-centered field of view of the agent.

    The observation represents the agent's relative view of the world. 

    The agent is NOT in the center of the observation grid.

    Observation grids are always square-sizes (i.e. 3x3, 5x5, 7x7).

    The width and height of the observation grid are called view size.

    The agent is ALWAYS at obs.image[view_size // 2, view_size - 1] in the observation `image`

    Your may make use of the state.get_field_of_view helper function.

    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the previous action that was taken
        empty_obs (TigerObservation): an empty observation that needs to be filled and returned
    Returns:
        obs (TigerObservation): observation of the agent
    """
    if action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        # When listening, the agent is more likely to hear the tiger correctly
        if state.tiger_location == TigerActions.LEFT:
            obs = random.choice([TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_LEFT, TigerObservationEnum.NONE])
        elif state.tiger_location == TigerActions.RIGHT:
            obs = random.choice([TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_RIGHT, TigerObservationEnum.NONE])
    else:
        # When opening a door, the agent does not hear anything
        obs = TigerObservationEnum.NONE

    return TigerObservation(obs=obs.value)
```

This implementation models the observation function based on the provided samples and the described logic of the environment. The `observation_func` returns an appropriate observation based on the current state and the action taken by the agent.
