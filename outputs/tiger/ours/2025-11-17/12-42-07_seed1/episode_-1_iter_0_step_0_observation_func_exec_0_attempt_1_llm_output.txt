The error you're encountering is due to the incorrect syntax used in the `TigerObservationEnum` definition. In Python, when defining an enumeration with values, you should use the assignment operator `=` for each member without commas between them.

Here is the corrected implementation of the `observation_func`:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

from uncertain_worms.structs import (
    Environment,
    Heuristic,
    InitialModel,
    Observation,
    ObservationModel,
    RewardModel,
    State,
    TransitionModel,
)


# --------------------------- Enums & Dataclasses -----------------------------#
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0
    HEAR_RIGHT = 1
    NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int  # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def observation_func(state: TigerState, action: int, empty_obs: TigerObservation) -> TigerObservation:
    """
    Represents the non-centered field of view of the agent.

    The observation represents the agent's relative view of the world. 

    The agent is NOT in the center of the observation grid.

    Observation grids are always square-sizes (i.e. 3x3, 5x5, 7x7).

    The width and height of the observation grid are called view size.

    The agent is ALWAYS at obs.image[view_size // 2, view_size - 1] in the observation `image`

    Your may make use of the state.get_field_of_view helper function.

    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the previous action that was taken
        empty_obs (TigerObservation): an empty observation that needs to be filled and returned
    Returns:
        obs (TigerObservation): observation of the agent
    """
    if action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        # When listening, the agent is more likely to hear the tiger correctly
        if state.tiger_location == TigerActions.LEFT:
            obs = random.choice([TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_LEFT, TigerObservationEnum.NONE])
        elif state.tiger_location == TigerActions.RIGHT:
            obs = random.choice([TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_RIGHT, TigerObservationEnum.NONE])
    else:
        # When opening a door, the agent does not hear anything
        obs = TigerObservationEnum.NONE

    return TigerObservation(obs=obs.value)
```

In this corrected version, the `TigerObservationEnum` is defined with each member assigned a value without commas between them. This should resolve the syntax error and allow your code to compile and run correctly.
