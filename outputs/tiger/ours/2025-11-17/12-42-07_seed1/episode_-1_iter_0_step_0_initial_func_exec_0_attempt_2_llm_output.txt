The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the `enum` module is not imported. To resolve this, we need to import the `enum` module at the beginning of the code.

Here is the corrected implementation with the necessary import:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

from uncertain_worms.structs import (
    Environment,
    Heuristic,
    InitialModel,
    Observation,
    ObservationModel,
    RewardModel,
    State,
    TransitionModel,
)
import enum  # Import the enum module


# --------------------------- Enums & Dataclasses -----------------------------#
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0
    HEAR_RIGHT = 1
    NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int  # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def initial_func(empty_state: TigerState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (TigerState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (TigerState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define the probabilities for the tiger location
    probabilities = [0.4, 0.6]  # 40% chance of LEFT, 60% chance of RIGHT
    
    # Sample the tiger location based on the defined probabilities
    tiger_location = random.choices([0, 1], weights=probabilities, k=1)[0]
    
    # Create and return the initial state
    return TigerState(tiger_location=tiger_location)
```

This should resolve the `NameError` by ensuring that the `enum` module is imported, allowing the `TigerObservationEnum` and `TigerActions` classes to be defined correctly.
