Certainly! Based on the provided samples, it appears that the reward is given only when the agent performs a specific action (opening a door) and the tiger is not behind the chosen door. The episode ends only when the agent opens a door.

Here's the implementation of the `reward_func`:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import enum
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

# --------------------------- Enums & Dataclasses -----------------------------#
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0
    HEAR_RIGHT = 1
    NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def reward_func(state: TigerState, action: int, next_state: TigerState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (TigerState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    if action == TigerActions.OPEN_LEFT and state.tiger_location == 1:
        return 1.0, True
    elif action == TigerActions.OPEN_RIGHT and state.tiger_location == 0:
        return 1.0, True
    else:
        return 0.0, (action in [TigerActions.OPEN_LEFT, TigerActions.OPEN_RIGHT])
```

### Explanation:
- **Reward Calculation**:
  - The agent receives a reward of `1.0` if it opens the door opposite to where the tiger is located.
  - If the agent opens the door where the tiger is located, or if the agent listens, the reward is `0.0`.

- **Episode Termination**:
  - The episode is marked as done (`done = True`) only when the agent opens a door, regardless of whether the tiger is behind it or not.
  - If the agent chooses to listen (`action == TigerActions.LISTEN`), the episode continues (`done = False`).

This function should accurately model the reward and termination conditions based on the provided samples.
