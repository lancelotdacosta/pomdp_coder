The error you're encountering is due to a syntax issue in the `TigerObservationEnum` class definition. The comma-separated values in the enum definition are causing the syntax error. Enums should be defined with each value on a separate line.

Here is the corrected implementation of the `initial_func` function, along with the corrected `TigerObservationEnum` class:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

from uncertain_worms.structs import (
    Environment,
    Heuristic,
    InitialModel,
    Observation,
    ObservationModel,
    RewardModel,
    State,
    TransitionModel,
)


# --------------------------- Enums & Dataclasses -----------------------------#
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0
    HEAR_RIGHT = 1
    NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int  # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def initial_func(empty_state: TigerState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (TigerState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (TigerState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define the probabilities for the tiger location
    probabilities = [0.4, 0.6]  # 40% chance of LEFT, 60% chance of RIGHT
    
    # Sample the tiger location based on the defined probabilities
    tiger_location = random.choices([0, 1], weights=probabilities, k=1)[0]
    
    # Create and return the initial state
    return TigerState(tiger_location=tiger_location)
```

This should resolve the syntax error and correctly model the initial state distribution based on the provided samples. The `TigerObservationEnum` class now has each value defined on a separate line, which is the correct syntax for Python enums.
