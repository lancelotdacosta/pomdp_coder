Based on the provided samples, it appears that the initial state distribution for the tiger location is biased towards the RIGHT door, but both LEFT and RIGHT doors are possible. Specifically, out of 5 samples, 3 have the tiger on the RIGHT and 2 on the LEFT. This suggests a 60% chance of the tiger being on the RIGHT and a 40% chance of the tiger being on the LEFT.

Here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function to model this distribution:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

from uncertain_worms.structs import (
    Environment,
    Heuristic,
    InitialModel,
    Observation,
    ObservationModel,
    RewardModel,
    State,
    TransitionModel,
)


# --------------------------- Enums & Dataclasses -----------------------------#
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0, HEAR_RIGHT = 1, NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def initial_func(empty_state: TigerState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (TigerState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (TigerState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define the probabilities for the tiger location
    probabilities = [0.4, 0.6]  # 40% chance of LEFT, 60% chance of RIGHT
    
    # Sample the tiger location based on the defined probabilities
    tiger_location = random.choices([0, 1], weights=probabilities, k=1)[0]
    
    # Create and return the initial state
    return TigerState(tiger_location=tiger_location)
```

This function initializes the tiger location based on the observed distribution from the samples. The `random.choices` function is used to sample from the specified probabilities.
