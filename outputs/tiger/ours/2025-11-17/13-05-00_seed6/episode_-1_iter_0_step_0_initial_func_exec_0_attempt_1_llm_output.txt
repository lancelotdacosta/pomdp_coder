The error you're encountering is due to the incorrect syntax in the `TigerObservationEnum` class definition. In Python, enum members should be defined with a single equals sign (`=`) without commas between them. Here is the corrected version of the `initial_func` function with the proper enum definition:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import copy
import enum
import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

from uncertain_worms.structs import (
    Environment,
    Heuristic,
    InitialModel,
    Observation,
    ObservationModel,
    RewardModel,
    State,
    TransitionModel,
)


# --------------------------- Enums & Dataclasses -----------------------------#
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0
    HEAR_RIGHT = 1
    NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int  # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def initial_func(empty_state: TigerState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (TigerState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (TigerState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define the probabilities based on the provided samples
    probabilities = [0.4, 0.6]  # Probability of tiger being on the left and right respectively

    # Sample the initial tiger location based on the defined probabilities
    tiger_location = random.choices([0, 1], weights=probabilities, k=1)[0]

    # Create the initial state with the sampled tiger location
    initial_state = copy.deepcopy(empty_state)
    initial_state.tiger_location = tiger_location

    return initial_state
```

This should resolve the `SyntaxError` and allow the code to compile and run correctly. The `TigerObservationEnum` class is now correctly defined with each member having its own line and a single equals sign (`=`).
