Based on the provided samples, it appears that the initial state distribution is biased towards the tiger being located on the right side of the grid. Specifically, out of the five samples, three indicate that the tiger is on the right (tiger_location=1) and two indicate that the tiger is on the left (tiger_location=0).

To model this distribution, we can use a probabilistic approach where the probability of the tiger being on the right side is 3/5 (0.6) and the probability of the tiger being on the left side is 2/5 (0.4).

Here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import copy
import enum
import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

from uncertain_worms.structs import (
    Environment,
    Heuristic,
    InitialModel,
    Observation,
    ObservationModel,
    RewardModel,
    State,
    TransitionModel,
)


# --------------------------- Enums & Dataclasses -----------------------------#
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0, HEAR_RIGHT = 1, NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def initial_func(empty_state: TigerState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (TigerState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (TigerState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define the probabilities based on the provided samples
    probabilities = [0.4, 0.6]  # Probability of tiger being on the left and right respectively

    # Sample the initial tiger location based on the defined probabilities
    tiger_location = random.choices([0, 1], weights=probabilities, k=1)[0]

    # Create the initial state with the sampled tiger location
    initial_state = copy.deepcopy(empty_state)
    initial_state.tiger_location = tiger_location

    return initial_state
```

This function uses the `random.choices` method to sample the tiger's initial location based on the provided probabilities. It then creates a new `TigerState` object with the sampled location and returns it as the initial state.
