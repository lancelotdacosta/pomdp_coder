Based on the provided samples and the observed discrepancies, it seems that there is an inconsistency in the reward values returned by the `reward_func` function. Specifically, the observed real-world samples show a reward of `1.0` for certain actions, while the current model returns a reward of `10.0`. This suggests that the reward for correctly opening the door without the tiger might be slightly different from what was initially assumed.

Let's refine the `reward_func` to better match the true distribution based on the observed data.

Here is the improved `reward_func`:

```python
def reward_func(state: TigerState, action: int, next_state: TigerState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (TigerState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Define the rewards for different actions and states
    if action == TigerActions.OPEN_LEFT:
        if state.tiger_location == 0:
            return -100.0, True  # Opening left door with tiger on the left
        else:
            return 1.0, True  # Opening left door with tiger on the right
    elif action == TigerActions.OPEN_RIGHT:
        if state.tiger_location == 1:
            return -100.0, True  # Opening right door with tiger on the right
        else:
            return 1.0, True  # Opening right door with tiger on the left
    elif action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        return 0.0, False  # Listening does not change the state and gives no reward

    # If the action is not recognized, return a default reward
    return 0.0, False
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reward for Correctly Opening the Door Without the Tiger:**
   - In the observed real-world samples, the reward for correctly opening the door without the tiger is `1.0`. This was different from the initially assumed `10.0`.
   - The updated function now returns `1.0` for correctly opening the door without the tiger.

2. **Reward for Opening the Door with the Tiger:**
   - The reward for opening the door with the tiger remains `-100.0`, as this action results in a significant penalty.

3. **Reward for Listening:**
   - The reward for listening remains `0.0`, as this action does not change the state and provides no immediate reward.

4. **Episode Termination:**
   - The episode terminates (`done = True`) when the agent opens either door, regardless of whether the tiger is behind it or not.
   - The episode does not terminate when the agent listens (`done = False`).

This refined `reward_func` should better align with the observed data and improve the model's accuracy.
