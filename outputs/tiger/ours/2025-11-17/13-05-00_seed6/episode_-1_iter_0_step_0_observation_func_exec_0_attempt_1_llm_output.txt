The error you're encountering is due to the incorrect syntax used in the `TigerObservationEnum` class definition. In Python, when defining an enum, you should not use commas between the values. Instead, you should use a single assignment per value.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `observation_func` function:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import copy
import enum
import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

# Import the necessary classes and enums from uncertain_worms.structs
from uncertain_worms.structs import (
    Environment,
    Heuristic,
    InitialModel,
    Observation,
    ObservationModel,
    RewardModel,
    State,
    TransitionModel,
)

# --------------------------- Enums & Dataclasses -----------------------------#

class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0
    HEAR_RIGHT = 1
    NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int  # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def observation_func(state, action, empty_obs):
    """
    Represents the non-centered field of view of the agent.

    The observation represents the agent's relative view of the world. 

    The agent is NOT in the center of the observation grid.

    Observation grids are always square-sizes (i.e. 3x3, 5x5, 7x7).

    The width and height of the observation grid are called view size.

    The agent is ALWAYS at obs.image[view_size // 2, view_size - 1] in the observation `image`

    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the previous action that was taken
        empty_obs (TigerObservation): an empty observation that needs to be filled and returned
    Returns:
        obs (TigerObservation): observation of the agent
    """
    if action != TigerActions.LISTEN:
        return TigerObservation(obs=TigerObservationEnum.NONE)

    # Define the probabilities for each observation given the tiger's location
    if state.tiger_location == 0:  # Tiger is on the left
        obs_probs = [0.85, 0.1, 0.05]
    else:  # Tiger is on the right
        obs_probs = [0.1, 0.85, 0.05]

    # Sample an observation based on the probabilities
    obs = random.choices(list(TigerObservationEnum), weights=obs_probs)[0]

    return TigerObservation(obs=obs)
```

In this corrected version:
- The `TigerObservationEnum` class is defined with each value on a separate line.
- The rest of the code remains the same, ensuring that the observation function behaves as expected.

This should resolve the syntax error and allow your code to compile and run correctly.
