You are a robot exploring its environment. 

Environment Description: 
Goal Description: 

Your goal is to model the the reward conditioned on state, action, next state transition. 
You need to implement the python code to model the world, as seen in the provided experiences. 
Please follow the template to implement the code. 
The code needs to be directly runnable (state, action, next_state) and return (reward, done). 


Below are a few samples from the environment distribution. These are only samples from a larger distribution that your should model.

Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Output float: 0.0
Output bool: False


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Output float: 0.0
Output bool: False


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Input int: 2
Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Output float: 0.0
Output bool: False


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Input int: 2
Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Output float: 0.0
Output bool: False


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Input int: 2
Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Output float: 0.0
Output bool: False




Here is the template for the reward_func function. Please implement
the reward function following the template. The code needs to be directly
runnable.

### Explanation

The reward function is designed to model the classic Tiger problem where the agent must determine which door to open without being eaten by the tiger. The environment provides a hidden state indicating the location of the tiger (either behind the left or right door) and three possible actions: opening the left door, opening the right door, or listening for clues.

- **Opening the Left Door (`OPEN_LEFT`)**:
  - If the tiger is behind the left door (`tiger_location == 0`), the agent receives a penalty of -100 and the episode ends.
  - If the tiger is behind the right door (`tiger_location == 1`), the agent receives a reward of 10 and the episode ends.

- **Opening the Right Door (`OPEN_RIGHT`)**:
  - If the tiger is behind the right door (`tiger_location == 1`), the agent receives a penalty of -100 and the episode ends.
  - If the tiger is behind the left door (`tiger_location == 0`), the agent receives a reward of 10 and the episode ends.

- **Listening (`LISTEN`)**:
  - Listening does not change the state and always results in a reward of 0. The episode continues.

The function returns both the reward and a boolean indicating whether the episode is done. This logic aligns with the provided samples and extends to other possible state-action transitions in the environment.
