The error is due to the incorrect syntax in the definition of `TigerObservationEnum`. In Python, you cannot define multiple values for an enum member using commas like that. Instead, you should define each member on a separate line.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import copy
import enum
import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

from uncertain_worms.structs import (
    Environment,
    Heuristic,
    InitialModel,
    Observation,
    ObservationModel,
    RewardModel,
    State,
    TransitionModel,
)


# --------------------------- Enums & Dataclasses -----------------------------#
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0
    HEAR_RIGHT = 1
    NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right


def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (TigerState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Define the rewards for different actions and states
    if action == TigerActions.OPEN_LEFT:
        if state.tiger_location == 0:
            return -100.0, True  # Opening left door with tiger on the left
        else:
            return 10.0, True  # Opening left door with tiger on the right
    elif action == TigerActions.OPEN_RIGHT:
        if state.tiger_location == 1:
            return -100.0, True  # Opening right door with tiger on the right
        else:
            return 10.0, True  # Opening right door with tiger on the left
    elif action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        return 0.0, False  # Listening does not change the state and gives no reward

    # If the action is not recognized, return a default reward
    return 0.0, False
```

### Explanation

The `TigerObservationEnum` class was incorrectly defined with multiple values on a single line. Each enum member should be defined on its own line. Here is the corrected `TigerObservationEnum`:

```python
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0
    HEAR_RIGHT = 1
    NONE = 2
```

This change ensures that the enum members are correctly defined and the code compiles without syntax errors. The rest of the code remains unchanged and should work as expected.
