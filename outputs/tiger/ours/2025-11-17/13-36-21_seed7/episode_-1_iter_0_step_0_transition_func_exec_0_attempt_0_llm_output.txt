Based on the provided samples, it appears that the environment state (tiger location) remains unchanged regardless of the action taken. The action `LISTEN` (action 2) does not change the tiger's location, and the actions `OPEN_LEFT` (action 0) and `OPEN_RIGHT` (action 1) also do not change the tiger's location.

Given this understanding, the transition function should simply return the current state without any changes.

Here is the implementation of the `transition_func` function:

```python
def transition_func(state: TigerState, action: int) -> TigerState:
    """
    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment 
        action (int): action to be taken in state `state`
    Returns:
        new_state (TigerState): the new state of the environment
    """
    # The tiger's location does not change regardless of the action taken
    return state
```

This function models the logic that the tiger's location remains fixed regardless of the actions performed by the agent.
