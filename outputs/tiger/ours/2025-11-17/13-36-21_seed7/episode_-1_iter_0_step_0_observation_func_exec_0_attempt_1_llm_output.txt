The error you're encountering is due to the incorrect syntax in the `TigerObservationEnum` class definition. In Python, when defining an enumeration with multiple values, you should use commas to separate the values but not include a trailing comma after the last value.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import copy
import enum
import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

from uncertain_worms.structs import (
    Environment,
    Heuristic,
    InitialModel,
    Observation,
    ObservationModel,
    RewardModel,
    State,
    TransitionModel,
)


# --------------------------- Enums & Dataclasses -----------------------------#
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0
    HEAR_RIGHT = 1
    NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def observation_func(state, action, empty_obs):
    """
    Represents the non-centered field of view of the agent.

    The observation represents the agent's relative view of the world. 

    The agent is NOT in the center of the observation grid.

    Observation grids are always square-sizes (i.e. 3x3, 5x5, 7x7).

    The width and height of the observation grid are called view size.

    The agent is ALWAYS at obs.image[view_size // 2, view_size - 1] in the observation `image`

    Your may make use of the state.get_field_of_view helper function.

    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the previous action that was taken
        empty_obs (TigerObservation): an empty observation that needs to be filled and returned
    Returns:
        obs (TigerObservation): observation of the agent
    """
    # Define the probabilities for each observation given the tiger's location
    if state.tiger_location == 0:  # Tiger is behind the left door
        probabilities = [0.85, 0.10, 0.05]
    else:  # Tiger is behind the right door
        probabilities = [0.10, 0.85, 0.05]

    # Choose an observation based on the probabilities
    observation = random.choices([0, 1, 2], weights=probabilities, k=1)[0]

    # Fill the empty observation with the chosen observation
    empty_obs.obs = observation

    return empty_obs
```

In this corrected version, the `TigerObservationEnum` class definition uses separate lines for each value without trailing commas:

```python
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0
    HEAR_RIGHT = 1
    NONE = 2
```

This should resolve the syntax error you encountered. The `observation_func` function remains unchanged and should work as intended.
