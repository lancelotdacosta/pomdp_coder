The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the `enum` module is referenced but not imported in the scope where it is used. To fix this, you need to ensure that the `enum` module is imported before it is used in the `TigerObservationEnum` class definition.

Here is the corrected code with the necessary import statement:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import copy
import random
from dataclasses import dataclass, replace
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

import enum  # Ensure enum is imported

from uncertain_worms.structs import (
    Environment,
    Heuristic,
    InitialModel,
    Observation,
    ObservationModel,
    RewardModel,
    State,
    TransitionModel,
)


# --------------------------- Enums & Dataclasses -----------------------------#
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0
    HEAR_RIGHT = 1
    NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def observation_func(state, action, empty_obs):
    """
    Represents the non-centered field of view of the agent.

    The observation represents the agent's relative view of the world. 

    The agent is NOT in the center of the observation grid.

    Observation grids are always square-sizes (i.e. 3x3, 5x5, 7x7).

    The width and height of the observation grid are called view size.

    The agent is ALWAYS at obs.image[view_size // 2, view_size - 1] in the observation `image`

    Your may make use of the state.get_field_of_view helper function.

    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the previous action that was taken
        empty_obs (TigerObservation): an empty observation that needs to be filled and returned
    Returns:
        obs (TigerObservation): observation of the agent
    """
    # Define the probabilities for each observation given the tiger's location
    if state.tiger_location == 0:  # Tiger is behind the left door
        probabilities = [0.85, 0.10, 0.05]
    else:  # Tiger is behind the right door
        probabilities = [0.10, 0.85, 0.05]

    # Choose an observation based on the probabilities
    observation = random.choices([0, 1, 2], weights=probabilities, k=1)[0]

    # Create a new observation instance with the chosen observation
    new_obs = replace(empty_obs, obs=observation)

    return new_obs
```

In this corrected version, the `enum` module is imported at the beginning of the file, ensuring that it is available when defining the `TigerObservationEnum` class. This should resolve the `NameError` you encountered.
