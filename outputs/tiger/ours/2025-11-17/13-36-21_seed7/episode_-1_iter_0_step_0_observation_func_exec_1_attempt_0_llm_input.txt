You are a robot exploring its environment. 

Environment Description: 
Goal Description: 

Your goal is to model the the distribution of observations conditioned on a state. 
You need to implement the python code to model the world, as seen in the provided experiences. 
Please follow the template to implement the code. 
The code needs to be directly runnable (state) and return a sample (observation). 


Below are a few samples from the environment distribution. These are only samples from a larger distribution that your should model.

Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=1)


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=0)


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=1)


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=1)


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 0
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=2)




Here is the template for the observation_func function. Please implement
the reward function following the template. The code needs to be directly
runnable.

Explain what you believe is the the distribution of observations conditioned on a state in english.
Additionally, please implement code to model the logic of the world. Please implement the 
code following the template. Only output the definition for ‘ observation_func ‘. 
You must implement the ‘ observation_func ‘ function.
Create any helper function inside the scope of ‘ observation_func ‘. 
Do not create any helper function outside the scope of ‘ observation_func ‘.
Do not output examples usage. 
Do not create any new classes.
Do not rewrite existing classes. 
Do not import any new modules from anywhere.
Do not overfit to the specific samples.
Put the ‘ observation_func ‘ function in a python code block.

The distribution of observations conditioned on a state in the Tiger problem can be described as follows:

- If the tiger is behind the left door (tiger_location = 0):
  - The agent is more likely to hear the tiger on the left (obs = 0).
  - There is a small probability of hearing the tiger on the right (obs = 1) due to noise or uncertainty.
  - There is also a small probability of hearing nothing (obs = 2).

- If the tiger is behind the right door (tiger_location = 1):
  - The agent is more likely to hear the tiger on the right (obs = 1).
  - There is a small probability of hearing the tiger on the left (obs = 0) due to noise or uncertainty.
  - There is also a small probability of hearing nothing (obs = 2).

Given this understanding, we can implement the `observation_func` function to model these probabilities.

```

This implementation models the observation distribution conditioned on the state of the environment, where the agent has a higher probability of hearing the tiger on the correct side and a smaller probability of hearing it incorrectly or not hearing anything at all.

SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Maybe you meant '==' or ':=' instead of '='?

#define assistant
The error you're encountering is due to the incorrect syntax in the `TigerObservationEnum` class definition. In Python, when defining an enumeration with multiple values, you should use commas to separate the values but not include a trailing comma after the last value.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import copy
import enum
import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

from uncertain_worms.structs import (
    Environment,

    HEAR_RIGHT = 1
    NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def observation_func(state, action, empty_obs):
    """

    # Define the probabilities for each observation given the tiger's location
    if state.tiger_location == 0:  # Tiger is behind the left door
        probabilities = [0.85, 0.10, 0.05]
    else:  # Tiger is behind the right door
        probabilities = [0.10, 0.85, 0.05]

    # Choose an observation based on the probabilities
    observation = random.choices([0, 1, 2], weights=probabilities, k=1)[0]

    # Fill the empty observation with the chosen observation
    empty_obs.obs = observation

    return empty_obs
```

In this corrected version, the `TigerObservationEnum` class definition uses separate lines for each value without trailing commas:

```python
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0
    HEAR_RIGHT = 1
    NONE = 2
```

This should resolve the syntax error you encountered. The `observation_func` function remains unchanged and should work as intended.
