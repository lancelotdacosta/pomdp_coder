It seems that the `replace` function from the `dataclasses` module is still not being recognized. This could be due to the way the code is being loaded or executed in your environment. To ensure that the `replace` function is available, we can explicitly import it within the `observation_func` function.

Here is the corrected code with the `replace` function imported locally within the `observation_func`:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import copy
import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

import enum  # Ensure enum is imported

from uncertain_worms.structs import (
    Environment,
    Heuristic,
    InitialModel,
    Observation,
    ObservationModel,
    RewardModel,
    State,
    TransitionModel,
)


# --------------------------- Enums & Dataclasses -----------------------------#
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0
    HEAR_RIGHT = 1
    NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def observation_func(state, action, empty_obs):
    """
    Represents the non-centered field of view of the agent.

    The observation represents the agent's relative view of the world. 

    The agent is NOT in the center of the observation grid.

    Observation grids are always square-sizes (i.e. 3x3, 5x5, 7x7).

    The width and height of the observation grid are called view size.

    The agent is ALWAYS at obs.image[view_size // 2, view_size - 1] in the observation `image`

    Your may make use of the state.get_field_of_view helper function.

    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the previous action that was taken
        empty_obs (TigerObservation): an empty observation that needs to be filled and returned
    Returns:
        obs (TigerObservation): observation of the agent
    """
    from dataclasses import replace  # Import replace locally

    # Define the probabilities for each observation given the tiger's location
    if state.tiger_location == 0:  # Tiger is behind the left door
        probabilities = [0.85, 0.10, 0.05]
    else:  # Tiger is behind the right door
        probabilities = [0.10, 0.85, 0.05]

    # Choose an observation based on the probabilities
    observation = random.choices([0, 1, 2], weights=probabilities, k=1)[0]

    # Create a new observation instance with the chosen observation
    new_obs = replace(empty_obs, obs=observation)

    return new_obs
```

In this corrected version, the `replace` function is imported locally within the `observation_func` function to ensure it is available when needed. This should resolve the `NameError` you encountered.

By importing `replace` within the function, we ensure that it is in the scope where it is used, which might help avoid any issues related to how the code is being loaded or executed in your environment.
