Certainly! Let's first explain the distribution of observations conditioned on a state in English:

### Distribution Explanation

1. **When the agent performs the `LISTEN` action:**
   - If the tiger is on the left (`tiger_location == 0`):
     - The agent is more likely to hear the tiger on the left (0.8 probability).
     - There is a small chance of hearing nothing (0.2 probability).
   - If the tiger is on the right (`tiger_location == 1`):
     - The agent is more likely to hear the tiger on the right (0.8 probability).
     - There is a small chance of hearing nothing (0.2 probability).

2. **When the agent performs any other action (e.g., `OPEN_LEFT`, `OPEN_RIGHT`):**
   - The observations are less reliable.
   - If the tiger is on the left (`tiger_location == 0`):
     - The agent has a small chance of hearing the tiger on the left (0.1 probability).
     - The agent has a small chance of hearing the tiger on the right (0.1 probability).
     - The agent has a high chance of hearing nothing (0.8 probability).
   - If the tiger is on the right (`tiger_location == 1`):
     - The agent has a small chance of hearing the tiger on the left (0.1 probability).
     - The agent has a small chance of hearing the tiger on the right (0.1 probability).
     - The agent has a high chance of hearing nothing (0.8 probability).

### Improved Code

Now, let's improve the `observation_func` function to better model the true distribution:

```python
def observation_func(state: TigerState, action: int, empty_obs: TigerObservation) -> TigerObservation:
    """
    Represents the non-centered field of view of the agent.

    The observation represents the agent's relative view of the world. 

    The agent is NOT in the center of the observation grid.

    Observation grids are always square-sizes (i.e. 3x3, 5x5, 7x7).

    The width and height of the observation grid are called view size.

    The agent is ALWAYS at obs.image[view_size // 2, view_size - 1] in the observation `image`

    Your may make use of the state.get_field_of_view helper function.

    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the previous action that was taken
        empty_obs (TigerObservation): an empty observation that needs to be filled and returned
    Returns:
        obs (TigerObservation): observation of the agent
    """
    if action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        if state.tiger_location == 0:  # Tiger is on the left
            # More likely to hear the tiger on the left when listening
            obs = random.choices([TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_LEFT, TigerObservationEnum.NONE], [0.8, 0.2])[0]
        else:  # Tiger is on the right
            # More likely to hear the tiger on the right when listening
            obs = random.choices([TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_RIGHT, TigerObservationEnum.NONE], [0.8, 0.2])[0]
    else:
        if state.tiger_location == 0:  # Tiger is on the left
            # Less likely to hear the tiger on the left when not listening
            obs = random.choices([TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_LEFT, TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_RIGHT, TigerObservationEnum.NONE], [0.1, 0.1, 0.8])[0]
        else:  # Tiger is on the right
            # Less likely to hear the tiger on the right when not listening
            obs = random.choices([TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_LEFT, TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_RIGHT, TigerObservationEnum.NONE], [0.1, 0.1, 0.8])[0]

    return TigerObservation(obs=obs.value)
```

This function should now better reflect the true distribution of observations conditioned on the state and action. The probabilities are adjusted to ensure that the agent's observations are more consistent with the real-world samples provided.
