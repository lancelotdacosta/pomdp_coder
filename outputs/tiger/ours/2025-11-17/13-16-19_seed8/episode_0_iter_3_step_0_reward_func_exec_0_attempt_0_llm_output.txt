Certainly! Based on the provided samples, it seems that there is a small probability (10%) of not receiving the penalty even when opening the door where the tiger is located. Additionally, there is a possibility of receiving a reward or no reward when the tiger is not behind the door.

Here's an improved version of the `reward_func` function to better model the true distribution:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import copy
import enum
import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

# Assuming the necessary classes and enums are already defined as in the provided code

def reward_func(state: TigerState, action: int, next_state: TigerState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (TigerState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    reward = 0.0
    done = False
    
    if action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        # Listening does not change the state and provides no immediate reward.
        pass
    elif action == TigerActions.OPEN_LEFT:
        if state.tiger_location == 0:
            # Opening left door when the tiger is behind it results in a penalty.
            # However, there might be a small probability of not receiving a penalty.
            if random.random() < 0.9:  # 90% chance of receiving the penalty
                reward = -1.0
            else:
                reward = 0.0
        else:
            # Opening left door when the tiger is not behind it results in a reward.
            if random.random() < 0.9:  # 90% chance of receiving the reward
                reward = 1.0
            else:
                reward = 0.0
        done = True
    elif action == TigerActions.OPEN_RIGHT:
        if state.tiger_location == 1:
            # Opening right door when the tiger is behind it results in a penalty.
            # However, there might be a small probability of not receiving a penalty.
            if random.random() < 0.9:  # 90% chance of receiving the penalty
                reward = -1.0
            else:
                reward = 0.0
        else:
            # Opening right door when the tiger is not behind it results in a reward.
            if random.random() < 0.9:  # 90% chance of receiving the reward
                reward = 1.0
            else:
                reward = 0.0
        done = True
    
    return reward, done
```

### Explanation
- **Listening Action**: This action does not change the state and provides no immediate reward. The reward remains `0.0` and `done` remains `False`.
- **Opening Left Door**:
  - If the tiger is behind the left door (`state.tiger_location == 0`), there is a 90% chance of receiving a penalty (`-1.0`) and a 10% chance of receiving no penalty (`0.0`).
  - If the tiger is not behind the left door (`state.tiger_location == 1`), there is a 90% chance of receiving a reward (`1.0`) and a 10% chance of receiving no reward (`0.0`).
- **Opening Right Door**:
  - If the tiger is behind the right door (`state.tiger_location == 1`), there is a 90% chance of receiving a penalty (`-1.0`) and a 10% chance of receiving no penalty (`0.0`).
  - If the tiger is not behind the right door (`state.tiger_location == 0`), there is a 90% chance of receiving a reward (`1.0`) and a 10% chance of receiving no reward (`0.0`).

This updated function should better reflect the true distribution observed in the real world.
