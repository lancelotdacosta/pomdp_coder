### Explanation in English:
The reward function in the Tiger problem is designed to encourage the agent to open the correct door (where the tiger is not) and to penalize opening the wrong door (where the tiger is). The specific conditions are as follows:

1. **Open Left Door (action = 0):**
   - If the tiger is behind the left door (state.tiger_location == LEFT), the agent receives a negative reward of -1.0 and the episode ends (done = True).
   - If the tiger is behind the right door (state.tiger_location == RIGHT), the agent receives a positive reward of 1.0 and the episode ends (done = True).

2. **Open Right Door (action = 1):**
   - If the tiger is behind the right door (state.tiger_location == RIGHT), the agent receives a negative reward of -1.0 and the episode ends (done = True).
   - If the tiger is behind the left door (state.tiger_location == LEFT), the agent receives a positive reward of 1.0 and the episode ends (done = True).

3. **Listen (action = 2):**
   - Listening does not change the state or the reward. The agent receives a reward of 0.0, and the episode continues (done = False).

This reward structure ensures that the agent learns to avoid opening the door with the tiger and to use the listening action to gain information about the tiger's location.
