#define system
You are a robot exploring its environment. 

Environment Description: 
Goal Description: 

Your goal is to model the the distribution of observations conditioned on a state. 
You need to implement the python code to model the world, as seen in the provided experiences. 
Please follow the template to implement the code. 
The code needs to be directly runnable (state) and return a sample (observation). 


Below are a few samples from the environment distribution. These are only samples from a larger distribution that your should model.

Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=0)


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=1)


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 0
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=2)


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=1)


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=0)




Here is the template for the observation_func function. Please implement
the reward function following the template. The code needs to be directly
runnable.

    Represents the non-centered field of view of the agent.

    The observation represents the agent's relative view of the world. 

    The agent is NOT in the center of the observation grid.

    Observation grids are always square-sizes (i.e. 3x3, 5x5, 7x7).

    The width and height of the observation grid are called view size.

    The agent is ALWAYS at obs.image[view_size // 2, view_size - 1] in the observation `image`

    Your may make use of the state.get_field_of_view helper function.

    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the previous action that was taken
        empty_obs (TigerObservation): an empty observation that needs to be filled and returned
    Returns:
        obs (TigerObservation): observation of the agent

Explain what you believe is the the distribution of observations conditioned on a state in english.
Additionally, please implement code to model the logic of the world. Please implement the 
code following the template. Only output the definition for ‘ observation_func ‘. 
You must implement the ‘ observation_func ‘ function.
Create any helper function inside the scope of ‘ observation_func ‘. 
Do not create any helper function outside the scope of ‘ observation_func ‘.
Do not output examples usage. 
Do not create any new classes.
Do not rewrite existing classes. 
Do not import any new modules from anywhere.
Do not overfit to the specific samples.
Put the ‘ observation_func ‘ function in a python code block.
