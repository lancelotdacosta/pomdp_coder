Based on the provided samples and the nature of the Tiger problem, we can infer that the agent's observation is influenced by the tiger's location and the action taken. Specifically:

1. **When the tiger is on the right (tiger_location = 1):**
   - The agent may hear the tiger on the right (obs = 1) or left (obs = 0) with some probability.
   - There is also a small probability that the agent hears nothing (obs = 2).

2. **When the tiger is on the left (tiger_location = 0):**
   - The agent may hear the tiger on the left (obs = 0) or right (obs = 1) with some probability.
   - There is also a small probability that the agent hears nothing (obs = 2).

The action "LISTEN" (action = 2) seems to have the most influence on the observation, while actions "OPEN_LEFT" and "OPEN_RIGHT" do not provide new observations but rather lead to a reward or penalty.

Given this understanding, we can model the observation distribution as follows:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import copy
import enum
import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

from uncertain_worms.structs import (
    Environment,
    Heuristic,
    InitialModel,
    Observation,
    ObservationModel,
    RewardModel,
    State,
    TransitionModel,
)


# --------------------------- Enums & Dataclasses -----------------------------#
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0
    HEAR_RIGHT = 1
    NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def observation_func(state, action, empty_obs):
    """
    Represents the non-centered field of view of the agent.

    The observation represents the agent's relative view of the world. 

    The agent is NOT in the center of the observation grid.

    Observation grids are always square-sizes (i.e. 3x3, 5x5, 7x7).

    The width and height of the observation grid are called view size.

    The agent is ALWAYS at obs.image[view_size // 2, view_size - 1] in the observation `image`

    Your may make use of the state.get_field_of_view helper function.

    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the previous action that was taken
        empty_obs (TigerObservation): an empty observation that needs to be filled and returned
    Returns:
        obs (TigerObservation): observation of the agent
    """
    if action != TigerActions.LISTEN:
        return empty_obs

    if state.tiger_location == 1:  # Tiger is on the right
        probabilities = [0.15, 0.7, 0.15]  # [hear left, hear right, none]
    else:  # Tiger is on the left
        probabilities = [0.7, 0.15, 0.15]  # [hear left, hear right, none]

    obs_index = random.choices(range(3), probabilities)[0]
    return TigerObservation(obs=obs_index)
```

This implementation models the observation distribution based on the tiger's location and the action taken. When the agent listens (action = 2), it has a higher probability of hearing the correct direction of the tiger, with some noise allowing for incorrect observations or no sound at all.
