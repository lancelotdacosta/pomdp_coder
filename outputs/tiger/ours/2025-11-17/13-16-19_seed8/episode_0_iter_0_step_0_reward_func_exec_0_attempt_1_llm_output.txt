It looks like there's a syntax error in the `TigerObservationEnum` class due to the incorrect use of commas. Let's correct that and ensure the `reward_func` is implemented correctly. Here's the revised code:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import copy
import enum
import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

from uncertain_worms.structs import (
    Environment,
    Heuristic,
    InitialModel,
    Observation,
    ObservationModel,
    RewardModel,
    State,
    TransitionModel,
)


# --------------------------- Enums & Dataclasses -----------------------------#
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0
    HEAR_RIGHT = 1
    NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def reward_func(state: TigerState, action: int, next_state: TigerState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (TigerState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    reward = 0.0
    done = False
    
    if action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        # Listening does not change the state and provides no immediate reward.
        pass
    elif action == TigerActions.OPEN_LEFT:
        if state.tiger_location == 0:
            # Opening left door when the tiger is behind it results in a penalty.
            reward = -1.0
        else:
            # Opening left door when the tiger is not behind it results in a reward.
            reward = 1.0
        done = True
    elif action == TigerActions.OPEN_RIGHT:
        if state.tiger_location == 1:
            # Opening right door when the tiger is behind it results in a penalty.
            reward = -1.0
        else:
            # Opening right door when the tiger is not behind it results in a reward.
            reward = 1.0
        done = True
    
    return reward, done
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code

1. **TigerObservationEnum**:
   - The `HEAR_LEFT`, `HEAR_RIGHT`, and `NONE` values are now correctly defined without commas between them.

2. **Reward Function**:
   - The reward function remains unchanged from the previous implementation.
   - It checks the action and the state to determine the appropriate reward and whether the episode is done.
   - Listening (`TigerActions.LISTEN`) does not change the state or provide an immediate reward.
   - Opening a door (`TigerActions.OPEN_LEFT` or `TigerActions.OPEN_RIGHT`) results in a reward or penalty based on the tiger's location and marks the episode as done.

This should resolve the syntax error and ensure the code is directly runnable.
