To better model the true distribution of observations conditioned on a state, let's first describe the expected distribution in English:

1. **When the agent listens (action = `TigerActions.LISTEN`):**
   - If the tiger is on the left (`tiger_location == 0`), the agent should hear the tiger on the left with high probability (e.g., 0.8), and hear nothing with a lower probability (e.g., 0.2).
   - If the tiger is on the right (`tiger_location == 1`), the agent should hear the tiger on the right with high probability (e.g., 0.8), and hear nothing with a lower probability (e.g., 0.2).

2. **When the agent does not listen (action = `TigerActions.OPEN_LEFT` or `TigerActions.OPEN_RIGHT`):**
   - If the tiger is on the left (`tiger_location == 0`):
     - The agent should hear the tiger on the left with a low probability (e.g., 0.1),
     - Hear the tiger on the right with a low probability (e.g., 0.1),
     - Hear nothing with a higher probability (e.g., 0.8).
   - If the tiger is on the right (`tiger_location == 1`):
     - The agent should hear the tiger on the left with a low probability (e.g., 0.1),
     - Hear the tiger on the right with a low probability (e.g., 0.1),
     - Hear nothing with a higher probability (e.g., 0.8).

Given this distribution, we will update the `observation_func` function to better reflect these probabilities.

```python
def observation_func(state, action, empty_obs):
    """
    Represents the non-centered field of view of the agent.

    The observation represents the agent's relative view of the world. 

    The agent is NOT in the center of the observation grid.

    Observation grids are always square-sizes (i.e. 3x3, 5x5, 7x7).

    The width and height of the observation grid are called view size.

    The agent is ALWAYS at obs.image[view_size // 2, view_size - 1] in the observation `image`

    Your may make use of the state.get_field_of_view helper function.

    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the previous action that was taken
        empty_obs (TigerObservation): an empty observation that needs to be filled and returned
    Returns:
        obs (TigerObservation): observation of the agent
    """
    if action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        if state.tiger_location == 0:  # Tiger is on the left
            # More likely to hear the tiger on the left when listening
            obs = random.choices([TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_LEFT, TigerObservationEnum.NONE], [0.8, 0.2])[0]
        else:  # Tiger is on the right
            # More likely to hear the tiger on the right when listening
            obs = random.choices([TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_RIGHT, TigerObservationEnum.NONE], [0.8, 0.2])[0]
    else:
        if state.tiger_location == 0:  # Tiger is on the left
            # Less likely to hear the tiger on the left when not listening
            obs = random.choices([TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_LEFT, TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_RIGHT, TigerObservationEnum.NONE], [0.1, 0.1, 0.8])[0]
        else:  # Tiger is on the right
            # Less likely to hear the tiger on the right when not listening
            obs = random.choices([TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_LEFT, TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_RIGHT, TigerObservationEnum.NONE], [0.1, 0.1, 0.8])[0]

    return TigerObservation(obs=obs.value)
```

This updated function should better model the true distribution of observations conditioned on the state and action. The probabilities for each observation are adjusted to reflect the expected behavior in the environment.
