#define system
You are a robot exploring its environment. 



Your goal is to model the distribution of observations conditioned on a state of the world in python. 

You have tried it before and came up with one partially correct solution, but it is not perfect. 

The observed distribution disagrees with the generated model in several cases.
You need to improve your code to come closer to the true distribution.

Here is a solution you came up with before.

    Represents the non-centered field of view of the agent.

    The observation represents the agent's relative view of the world. 

    The agent is NOT in the center of the observation grid.

    Observation grids are always square-sizes (i.e. 3x3, 5x5, 7x7).

    The width and height of the observation grid are called view size.

    The agent is ALWAYS at obs.image[view_size // 2, view_size - 1] in the observation `image`

    Your may make use of the state.get_field_of_view helper function.

Here are some samples from the real world that were impossible under your model
Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=0)



And here are some samples from your code under the same conditions
Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=1)


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=2)



Here are some samples from the real world that were impossible under your model
Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=1)



And here are some samples from your code under the same conditions
Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=0)


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=2)





Explain what you believe is the distribution of observations conditioned on a state in english, then improve your code to better model the true distribution.

Please implement the code for the following the template. 
You must implement the ‘ observation_func ‘ function. 

The code needs to be directly runnable with (state) and return a sample (observation). 

Do not output examples. 
Do not create any new classes. 
Do not rewrite existing classes.
Do not import any new modules from anywhere.
Do not list out specific indices that overfit to the examples, but include ranges.
Put the ‘ observation_func ‘ function in a python code block.
