Certainly! Based on the environment description and the provided samples, it appears that there is a small probability of the reward being zero even when the agent opens the door where the tiger is located. This suggests that the environment occasionally provides a zero reward regardless of the underlying state or action.

Let's refine the `reward_func` to better model this behavior by ensuring that the 5% chance of a zero reward applies consistently across all actions that result in a terminal state (i.e., opening a door).

Here is the improved `reward_func`:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import copy
import enum
import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

# Assuming the necessary classes and enums are already defined as provided

def reward_func(state: TigerState, action: int, next_state: TigerState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (TigerState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    reward = 0.0
    done = False
    
    if action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        # Listening does not change the state and provides no immediate reward.
        pass
    elif action == TigerActions.OPEN_LEFT:
        if state.tiger_location == 0:
            # Opening left door when the tiger is behind it results in a penalty.
            reward = -1.0
        else:
            # Opening left door when the tiger is not behind it results in a reward.
            reward = 1.0
        done = True
    elif action == TigerActions.OPEN_RIGHT:
        if state.tiger_location == 1:
            # Opening right door when the tiger is behind it results in a penalty.
            reward = -1.0
        else:
            # Opening right door when the tiger is not behind it results in a reward.
            reward = 1.0
        done = True
    
    # Introduce a small probability of the environment providing a different reward
    if random.random() < 0.05:  # 5% chance
        reward = 0.0  # The environment occasionally provides a zero reward
    
    return reward, done
```

In this updated function, the 5% chance of receiving a zero reward is applied to all actions that result in a terminal state (i.e., opening a door). This should better match the observed distribution from the real world.
