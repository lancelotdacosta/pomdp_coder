You are a robot exploring its environment. 

Environment Description: 
Goal Description: 

Your goal is to model the the reward conditioned on state, action, next state transition. 
You need to implement the python code to model the world, as seen in the provided experiences. 
Please follow the template to implement the code. 
The code needs to be directly runnable (state, action, next_state) and return (reward, done). 


Below are a few samples from the environment distribution. These are only samples from a larger distribution that your should model.

Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Input int: 2
Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Output float: 0.0
Output bool: False


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Output float: 0.0
Output bool: False


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 0
Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Output float: 1.0
Output bool: True


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Output float: 0.0
Output bool: False


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Input int: 2
Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Output float: 0.0
Output bool: False




Here is the template for the reward_func function. Please implement
the reward function following the template. The code needs to be directly
runnable.

### Explanation of the Reward Function

The reward function is designed to model the classic Tiger problem, where an agent must decide whether to open the left or right door to find treasure while avoiding a tiger. The environment provides the following logic:

1. **Listening Action (2)**: 
   - Listening does not change the state of the environment and provides no immediate reward.
   - The episode is not considered done after listening.

2. **Opening Left Door (0)**:
   - If the tiger is behind the left door (`state.tiger_location == 0`), the agent receives a penalty of -1.0.
   - If the tiger is not behind the left door (`state.tiger_location == 1`), the agent receives a reward of 1.0.
   - The episode is considered done after opening a door.

3. **Opening Right Door (1)**:
   - If the tiger is behind the right door (`state.tiger_location == 1`), the agent receives a penalty of -1.0.
   - If the tiger is not behind the right door (`state.tiger_location == 0`), the agent receives a reward of 1.0.
   - The episode is considered done after opening a door.

This function ensures that the agent is rewarded for making the correct decision and penalized for making the wrong one, while allowing the agent to gather more information by listening before making a decision.
