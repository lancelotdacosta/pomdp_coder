It looks like there was a syntax error in the definition of `TigerObservationEnum`. The issue arises from the incorrect use of commas in the enum definition. Let's correct it by removing the commas and redefining the enum properly.

Here is the corrected implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import copy
import enum
import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

from uncertain_worms.structs import (
    Environment,
    Heuristic,
    InitialModel,
    Observation,
    ObservationModel,
    RewardModel,
    State,
    TransitionModel,
)


# --------------------------- Enums & Dataclasses -----------------------------#
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0
    HEAR_RIGHT = 1
    NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int  # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def initial_func(empty_state: TigerState) -> TigerState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (TigerState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (TigerState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define the probabilities based on the provided samples
    probabilities = [0.4, 0.6]  # Probability of tiger being on the left and right respectively
    
    # Choose a random location based on the probabilities
    tiger_location = random.choices([0, 1], weights=probabilities)[0]
    
    # Create and return the initial state
    return TigerState(tiger_location=tiger_location)
```

This should resolve the syntax error and correctly model the distribution of initial states based on the provided samples. The `TigerObservationEnum` is now defined with each member on a separate line, which is the correct syntax for defining enums in Python.
