The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the `enum` module is not imported in the provided code. To fix this, we need to import the `enum` module at the beginning of the script.

Here is the corrected version of the `observation_func` function with the necessary import:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import random
import enum
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

from uncertain_worms.structs import (
    Environment,
    Heuristic,
    InitialModel,
    Observation,
    ObservationModel,
    RewardModel,
    State,
    TransitionModel,
)

# --------------------------- Enums & Dataclasses -----------------------------#
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0
    HEAR_RIGHT = 1
    NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right


def observation_func(state: TigerState, action: int, empty_obs: TigerObservation) -> TigerObservation:
    """
    Represents the non-centered field of view of the agent.

    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the previous action that was taken
        empty_obs (TigerObservation): an empty observation that needs to be filled and returned
    Returns:
        obs (TigerObservation): observation of the agent
    """
    if action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        if state.tiger_location == 0:  # Tiger is on the left
            obs = random.choices([TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_LEFT, TigerObservationEnum.NONE], [0.8, 0.2])[0]
        else:  # Tiger is on the right
            obs = random.choices([TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_RIGHT, TigerObservationEnum.NONE], [0.8, 0.2])[0]
    else:
        if state.tiger_location == 0:  # Tiger is on the left
            obs = random.choices([TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_LEFT, TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_RIGHT, TigerObservationEnum.NONE], [0.1, 0.1, 0.8])[0]
        else:  # Tiger is on the right
            obs = random.choices([TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_LEFT, TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_RIGHT, TigerObservationEnum.NONE], [0.1, 0.1, 0.8])[0]

    return TigerObservation(obs=obs.value)
```

This should resolve the `NameError` and allow the `observation_func` to be executed correctly. The `enum` module is now imported, ensuring that the `TigerObservationEnum` and `TigerActions` classes can be defined without any issues.
