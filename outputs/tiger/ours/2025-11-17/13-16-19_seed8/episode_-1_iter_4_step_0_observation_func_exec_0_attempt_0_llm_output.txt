Certainly! Let's analyze the current model and the real-world samples to understand the discrepancies and then improve the `observation_func` accordingly.

### Observation Distribution Analysis:

1. **State: Tiger on the Left (tiger_location=0)**
   - **Action: Listen (TigerActions.LISTEN)**
     - High probability of hearing the tiger on the left (HEAR_LEFT).
     - Low probability of hearing nothing (NONE).
     - Very low probability of hearing the tiger on the right (HEAR_RIGHT).
   - **Action: Not Listen (TigerActions.OPEN_LEFT, TigerActions.OPEN_RIGHT)**
     - Low probability of hearing the tiger on the left (HEAR_LEFT).
     - Low probability of hearing the tiger on the right (HEAR_RIGHT).
     - High probability of hearing nothing (NONE).

2. **State: Tiger on the Right (tiger_location=1)**
   - **Action: Listen (TigerActions.LISTEN)**
     - High probability of hearing the tiger on the right (HEAR_RIGHT).
     - Low probability of hearing nothing (NONE).
     - Very low probability of hearing the tiger on the left (HEAR_LEFT).
   - **Action: Not Listen (TigerActions.OPEN_LEFT, TigerActions.OPEN_RIGHT)**
     - Low probability of hearing the tiger on the left (HEAR_LEFT).
     - Low probability of hearing the tiger on the right (HEAR_RIGHT).
     - High probability of hearing nothing (NONE).

### Real-World Samples:
- When the tiger is on the left and the agent is not listening, the real-world samples show that it is possible to hear the tiger on the right.
- When the tiger is on the right and the agent is not listening, the real-world samples show that it is possible to hear the tiger on the left.

### Improved `observation_func`:

To better model the true distribution, we need to adjust the probabilities for the non-listening actions to account for the rare but possible cases where the agent might hear the tiger on the opposite side.

```python
def observation_func(state: TigerState, action: int, empty_obs: TigerObservation) -> TigerObservation:
    """
    Generates an observation based on the current state and action.

    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the previous action that was taken
        empty_obs (TigerObservation): an empty observation that needs to be filled and returned
    Returns:
        obs (TigerObservation): observation of the agent
    """
    if action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        if state.tiger_location == 0:  # Tiger is on the left
            # More likely to hear the tiger on the left when listening
            obs = random.choices([TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_LEFT, TigerObservationEnum.NONE], [0.8, 0.2])[0]
        else:  # Tiger is on the right
            # More likely to hear the tiger on the right when listening
            obs = random.choices([TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_RIGHT, TigerObservationEnum.NONE], [0.8, 0.2])[0]
    else:
        if state.tiger_location == 0:  # Tiger is on the left
            # Less likely to hear the tiger on the left when not listening
            obs = random.choices([TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_LEFT, TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_RIGHT, TigerObservationEnum.NONE], [0.1, 0.05, 0.85])[0]
        else:  # Tiger is on the right
            # Less likely to hear the tiger on the right when not listening
            obs = random.choices([TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_LEFT, TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_RIGHT, TigerObservationEnum.NONE], [0.05, 0.1, 0.85])[0]

    return TigerObservation(obs=obs.value)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Listening Actions (TigerActions.LISTEN):**
  - The probabilities remain the same as in the original code because the real-world samples do not contradict the model for listening actions.
- **Non-Listening Actions (TigerActions.OPEN_LEFT, TigerActions.OPEN_RIGHT):**
  - The probability of hearing the tiger on the opposite side is slightly increased to account for the rare but possible cases observed in the real world.
  - The probability of hearing nothing is adjusted to ensure the total probability sums to 1.

This adjustment should bring the generated observations closer to the true distribution observed in the real world.
