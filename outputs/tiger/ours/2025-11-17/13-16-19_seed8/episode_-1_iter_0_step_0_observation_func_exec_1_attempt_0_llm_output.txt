The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `LEFT` and `RIGHT` are not defined in the scope of the `observation_func`. Instead, you should use the integer values directly, as `tiger_location` is an integer (0 for LEFT and 1 for RIGHT).

Here is the corrected implementation of the `observation_func`:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import copy
import enum
import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

from uncertain_worms.structs import (
    Environment,
    Heuristic,
    InitialModel,
    Observation,
    ObservationModel,
    RewardModel,
    State,
    TransitionModel,
)

# --------------------------- Enums & Dataclasses -----------------------------#
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0
    HEAR_RIGHT = 1
    NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def observation_func(state, action, empty_obs):
    """
    Represents the non-centered field of view of the agent.

    The observation represents the agent's relative view of the world. 

    The agent is NOT in the center of the observation grid.

    Observation grids are always square-sizes (i.e. 3x3, 5x5, 7x7).

    The width and height of the observation grid are called view size.

    The agent is ALWAYS at obs.image[view_size // 2, view_size - 1] in the observation `image`

    Your may make use of the state.get_field_of_view helper function.

    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the previous action that was taken
        empty_obs (TigerObservation): an empty observation that needs to be filled and returned
    Returns:
        obs (TigerObservation): observation of the agent
    """
    if action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        if state.tiger_location == 0:  # Tiger is on the left
            # More likely to hear the tiger on the left when listening
            obs = random.choices([TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_LEFT, TigerObservationEnum.NONE], [0.8, 0.2])[0]
        else:  # Tiger is on the right
            # More likely to hear the tiger on the right when listening
            obs = random.choices([TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_RIGHT, TigerObservationEnum.NONE], [0.8, 0.2])[0]
    else:
        if state.tiger_location == 0:  # Tiger is on the left
            # Less likely to hear the tiger on the left when not listening
            obs = random.choices([TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_LEFT, TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_RIGHT, TigerObservationEnum.NONE], [0.1, 0.1, 0.8])[0]
        else:  # Tiger is on the right
            # Less likely to hear the tiger on the right when not listening
            obs = random.choices([TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_LEFT, TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_RIGHT, TigerObservationEnum.NONE], [0.1, 0.1, 0.8])[0]

    return TigerObservation(obs=obs.value)
```

In this corrected version, `LEFT` and `RIGHT` are replaced with their integer equivalents (0 for LEFT and 1 for RIGHT). This should resolve the `NameError` you were encountering.
