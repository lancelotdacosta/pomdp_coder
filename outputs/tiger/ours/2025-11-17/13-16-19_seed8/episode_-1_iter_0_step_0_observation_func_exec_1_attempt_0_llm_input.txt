You are a robot exploring its environment. 

Environment Description: 
Goal Description: 

Your goal is to model the the distribution of observations conditioned on a state. 
You need to implement the python code to model the world, as seen in the provided experiences. 
Please follow the template to implement the code. 
The code needs to be directly runnable (state) and return a sample (observation). 


Below are a few samples from the environment distribution. These are only samples from a larger distribution that your should model.

Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=0)


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=1)


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 0
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=2)


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=0)


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=1)




Here is the template for the observation_func function. Please implement
the reward function following the template. The code needs to be directly
runnable.

Explain what you believe is the the distribution of observations conditioned on a state in english.
Additionally, please implement code to model the logic of the world. Please implement the 
code following the template. Only output the definition for ‘ observation_func ‘. 
You must implement the ‘ observation_func ‘ function.
Create any helper function inside the scope of ‘ observation_func ‘. 
Do not create any helper function outside the scope of ‘ observation_func ‘.
Do not output examples usage. 
Do not create any new classes.
Do not rewrite existing classes. 
Do not import any new modules from anywhere.
Do not overfit to the specific samples.
Put the ‘ observation_func ‘ function in a python code block.

Based on the provided samples, it appears that the observations are probabilistic and depend on the state (tiger location) and the action taken by the agent. Specifically:

- When the tiger is located on the left (TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)):
  - If the action is `LISTEN` (action=2), the agent is more likely to hear the tiger on the left (TigerObservation(obs=0)).
  - If the action is not `LISTEN`, the observation can be either `NONE` (TigerObservation(obs=2)) or `HEAR_RIGHT` (TigerObservation(obs=1)), but this is less likely.

- When the tiger is located on the right (TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)):
  - If the action is `LISTEN` (action=2), the agent is more likely to hear the tiger on the right (TigerObservation(obs=1)).
  - If the action is not `LISTEN`, the observation can be either `NONE` (TigerObservation(obs=2)) or `HEAR_LEFT` (TigerObservation(obs=0)), but this is less likely.

The distribution of observations can be modeled as follows:

This implementation models the observation distribution based on the provided samples. The `random.choices` function is used to sample from the conditional probabilities defined for each state and action combination.
