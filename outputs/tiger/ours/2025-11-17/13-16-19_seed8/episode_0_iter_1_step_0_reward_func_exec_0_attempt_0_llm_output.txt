Based on the provided samples, it seems that the reward function in the real world might have some additional conditions or probabilistic behaviors that are not fully captured by the current implementation. Specifically, it appears that there might be cases where the agent does not receive a penalty when opening the door with the tiger behind it.

Here is an improved version of the `reward_func` function that accounts for this possibility:

```python
def reward_func(state: TigerState, action: int, next_state: TigerState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (TigerState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    reward = 0.0
    done = False
    
    if action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        # Listening does not change the state and provides no immediate reward.
        pass
    elif action == TigerActions.OPEN_LEFT:
        if state.tiger_location == 0:
            # Opening left door when the tiger is behind it results in a penalty.
            # However, there might be a small probability of not receiving a penalty.
            if random.random() < 0.9:  # 90% chance of receiving the penalty
                reward = -1.0
            else:
                reward = 0.0
        else:
            # Opening left door when the tiger is not behind it results in a reward.
            reward = 1.0
        done = True
    elif action == TigerActions.OPEN_RIGHT:
        if state.tiger_location == 1:
            # Opening right door when the tiger is behind it results in a penalty.
            # However, there might be a small probability of not receiving a penalty.
            if random.random() < 0.9:  # 90% chance of receiving the penalty
                reward = -1.0
            else:
                reward = 0.0
        else:
            # Opening right door when the tiger is not behind it results in a reward.
            reward = 1.0
        done = True
    
    return reward, done
```

In this improved version, there is a 10% chance that the agent will not receive a penalty when opening the door with the tiger behind it. This adjustment aims to better match the observed distribution from the real world.
