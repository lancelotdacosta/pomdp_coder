The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the constants `LEFT` and `RIGHT` are not defined in the scope where the `reward_func` function is being executed. To fix this, we need to ensure that these constants are properly defined within the function or passed as arguments.

Here's the revised `reward_func` function with the necessary constants defined:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (TigerState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Define the constants for LEFT and RIGHT
    LEFT = 0
    RIGHT = 1

    # Define the reward and done flags
    reward = 0.0
    done = False

    # Check if the action is to open a door
    if action == TigerActions.OPEN_LEFT:
        # If the tiger is behind the left door, the agent gets a negative reward
        if state.tiger_location == LEFT:
            reward = -1.0
            done = True
        else:
            reward = 1.0
            done = True
    elif action == TigerActions.OPEN_RIGHT:
        # If the tiger is behind the right door, the agent gets a negative reward
        if state.tiger_location == RIGHT:
            reward = -1.0
            done = True
        else:
            reward = 1.0
            done = True
    elif action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        # Listening does not change the state or the reward
        reward = 0.0
        done = False

    return reward, done
```

### Explanation:
- **Constants Definition**: The constants `LEFT` and `RIGHT` are defined within the `reward_func` function to avoid the `NameError`.
- **Reward Calculation**:
  - If the action is `OPEN_LEFT`, the agent receives a reward of -1.0 if the tiger is behind the left door, and 1.0 if the tiger is behind the right door.
  - If the action is `OPEN_RIGHT`, the agent receives a reward of -1.0 if the tiger is behind the right door, and 1.0 if the tiger is behind the left door.
  - If the action is `LISTEN`, the agent receives a reward of 0.0 and the episode continues.

This should resolve the `NameError` and ensure that the function works as expected.
