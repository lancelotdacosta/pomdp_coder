#define system
You are a robot exploring its environment. 

Environment Description: 
Goal Description: 

Your goal is to model the the reward conditioned on state, action, next state transition. 
You need to implement the python code to model the world, as seen in the provided experiences. 
Please follow the template to implement the code. 
The code needs to be directly runnable (state, action, next_state) and return (reward, done). 


Below are a few samples from the environment distribution. These are only samples from a larger distribution that your should model.

Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Output float: 0.0
Output bool: False


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Input int: 2
Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Output float: 0.0
Output bool: False


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Output float: 0.0
Output bool: False


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Output float: 0.0
Output bool: False


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Input int: 2
Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Output float: 0.0
Output bool: False




Here is the template for the reward_func function. Please implement
the reward function following the template. The code needs to be directly

Explain what you believe is the the reward conditioned on state, action, next state transition in english.
Additionally, please implement code to model the logic of the world. Please implement the 
code following the template. Only output the definition for ‘ reward_func ‘. 
You must implement the ‘ reward_func ‘ function.
Create any helper function inside the scope of ‘ reward_func ‘. 
Do not create any helper function outside the scope of ‘ reward_func ‘.
Do not output examples usage. 
Do not create any new classes.
Do not rewrite existing classes. 
Do not import any new modules from anywhere.
Do not overfit to the specific samples.
Put the ‘ reward_func ‘ function in a python code block.

### Explanation
The reward function is designed based on the classic Tiger problem:

- **Opening the Door with the Tiger**: If the agent chooses to open the door behind which the tiger is located, the episode ends with a large negative reward (-100.0).
- **Opening the Door without the Tiger**: If the agent chooses to open the door behind which the tiger is not located, the episode ends with a positive reward (10.0).
- **Listening**: If the agent chooses to listen, no immediate reward is given, and the episode continues.

The `reward_func` function takes the current state (`state`), the action taken (`action`), and the next state (`next_state`) as inputs and returns the reward and a boolean indicating whether the episode is done. The function handles the three possible actions: opening the left door, opening the right door, and listening.
