Certainly! Let's analyze the discrepancy between the real-world samples and the model's output.

### Explanation of the Reward Function
In the Tiger problem, the reward is conditioned on the state, action, and next state as follows:
- **Opening the Door with the Tiger**: If the agent opens the door where the tiger is located, it receives a large negative reward (-100.0) and the episode terminates.
- **Opening the Safe Door**: If the agent opens the door where there is no tiger, it receives a positive reward (10.0) and the episode terminates.
- **Listening**: If the agent listens, it receives no immediate reward (0.0) and the episode does not terminate.

The discrepancy in the provided samples suggests that there might be an additional factor affecting the reward that we need to account for. Specifically, the real-world samples show a reward of 1.0 in cases where the model predicts 10.0. This could indicate a small positive reward for a correct action, but with a lower magnitude than expected.

### Improved Reward Function
To better model the true distribution, we can introduce a small positive reward (1.0) for correctly opening the safe door, which aligns with the real-world samples provided.

Here is the improved `reward_func` function:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (TigerState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Define constants for tiger locations
    LEFT = 0
    RIGHT = 1
    
    # Define the reward based on the action and the state transition
    if action == TigerActions.OPEN_LEFT:
        if state.tiger_location == LEFT:
            return -100.0, True  # Tiger was behind the left door, negative reward
        else:
            return 1.0, True  # Tiger was behind the right door, small positive reward
    elif action == TigerActions.OPEN_RIGHT:
        if state.tiger_location == RIGHT:
            return -100.0, True  # Tiger was behind the right door, negative reward
        else:
            return 1.0, True  # Tiger was behind the left door, small positive reward
    elif action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        return 0.0, False  # Listening does not terminate the episode and gives no immediate reward
    
    # Default case (should not happen if actions are correctly defined)
    return 0.0, False
```

This updated function should better match the real-world samples provided. The key change is reducing the positive reward for correctly opening the safe door from 10.0 to 1.0.
