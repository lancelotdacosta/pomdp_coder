Based on the provided samples, it seems that the observations are conditioned on both the state (tiger location) and the action taken. Here's what I infer about the distribution:

- If the tiger is behind the LEFT door (state: `TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)`):
  - Listening (action: `LISTEN`) can result in hearing the tiger on the left (observation: `HEAR_LEFT`), hearing the tiger on the right (observation: `HEAR_RIGHT`), or no distinct sound (observation: `NONE`).
  - The likelihood of hearing the tiger on the left is higher than hearing it on the right or getting no sound.
  
- If the tiger is behind the RIGHT door (state: `TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)`):
  - Listening (action: `LISTEN`) can result in hearing the tiger on the right (observation: `HEAR_RIGHT`), hearing the tiger on the left (observation: `HEAR_LEFT`), or no distinct sound (observation: `NONE`).
  - The likelihood of hearing the tiger on the right is higher than hearing it on the left or getting no sound.

- If the action is not listening (e.g., opening a door), the observation is always `NONE`.

Here's the implementation of the `observation_func` function:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import copy
import enum
import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

from uncertain_worms.structs import (
    Environment,
    Heuristic,
    InitialModel,
    Observation,
    ObservationModel,
    RewardModel,
    State,
    TransitionModel,
)


# --------------------------- Enums & Dataclasses -----------------------------#
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0
    HEAR_RIGHT = 1
    NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def observation_func(state, action, empty_obs):
    """
    Represents the non-centered field of view of the agent.

    The observation represents the agent's relative view of the world. 

    The agent is NOT in the center of the observation grid.

    Observation grids are always square-sizes (i.e. 3x3, 5x5, 7x7).

    The width and height of the observation grid are called view size.

    The agent is ALWAYS at obs.image[view_size // 2, view_size - 1] in the observation `image`

    Your may make use of the state.get_field_of_view helper function.

    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the previous action that was taken
        empty_obs (TigerObservation): an empty observation that needs to be filled and returned
    Returns:
        obs (TigerObservation): observation of the agent
    """
    if action != TigerActions.LISTEN:
        return TigerObservation(obs=TigerObservationEnum.NONE)

    # Probability distribution for listening
    if state.tiger_location == 0:  # Tiger is behind the left door
        probabilities = [0.6, 0.3, 0.1]
    else:  # Tiger is behind the right door
        probabilities = [0.3, 0.6, 0.1]

    # Sample an observation based on the probabilities
    observation = random.choices(
        population=[TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_LEFT, TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_RIGHT, TigerObservationEnum.NONE],
        weights=probabilities,
        k=1
    )[0]

    return TigerObservation(obs=observation)
```

This function models the observation distribution based on the state and action. It returns the appropriate observation by sampling from a probability distribution that reflects the likelihood of hearing the tiger in different directions or getting no sound at all.
