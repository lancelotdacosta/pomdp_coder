Based on the provided samples, it appears that the environment's state transitions are as follows:

1. If the action is `LISTEN` (action 2), the state does not change regardless of the current state.
2. If the action is `OPEN_LEFT` (action 0) or `OPEN_RIGHT` (action 1), the state remains the same.

Given this understanding, the transition function can be implemented as follows:

```python
def transition_func(state: TigerState, action: int) -> TigerState:
    """
    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment 
        action (int): action to be taken in state `state`
    Returns:
        new_state (TigerState): the new state of the environment
    """
    if action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        # Listening does not change the state
        return state
    else:
        # Opening a door does not change the state
        return state
```

This implementation ensures that the state remains unchanged for all actions, as observed from the provided samples.
