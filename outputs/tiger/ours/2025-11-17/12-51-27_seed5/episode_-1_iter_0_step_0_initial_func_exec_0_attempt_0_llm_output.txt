Based on the provided samples, it appears that the distribution of initial states for the tiger problem is likely to be uniformly distributed between the two possible tiger locations (LEFT and RIGHT). Given the samples:

- TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
- TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
- TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
- TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
- TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)

We can see that both LEFT and RIGHT are represented, with a slight bias towards RIGHT. However, to model this distribution without overfitting to the specific samples, we will assume a uniform distribution.

Here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

from uncertain_worms.structs import (
    Environment,
    Heuristic,
    InitialModel,
    Observation,
    ObservationModel,
    RewardModel,
    State,
    TransitionModel,
)

# --------------------------- Enums & Dataclasses -----------------------------#
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0
    HEAR_RIGHT = 1
    NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def initial_func(empty_state: TigerState) -> TigerState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (TigerState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (TigerState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Assuming a uniform distribution for simplicity
    tiger_location = random.choice([0, 1])
    return TigerState(tiger_location=tiger_location)
```

This function will return a `TigerState` with the tiger location randomly set to either LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1), assuming a uniform distribution. This should be a reasonable model for the initial state distribution based on the provided samples.
