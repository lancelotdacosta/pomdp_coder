Certainly! Let's analyze the issue and improve the `reward_func` function.

### Analysis
The problem lies in the edge case handling for the `OPEN_LEFT` and `OPEN_RIGHT` actions. Specifically, when the tiger is behind the left door and the agent opens the left door, the reward should be -1.0 regardless of the next state. Similarly, when the tiger is behind the right door and the agent opens the right door, the reward should be -1.0 regardless of the next state.

However, in the provided samples, the observed behavior is that opening the left door when the tiger is behind the left door results in a reward of 0.0, which is inconsistent with the expected behavior. This suggests that there might be an edge case where the next state is different from the initial state, but the reward should still be -1.0.

### Improved Code
To address this, we will simplify the reward function to ensure that the reward is determined solely by the current state and action, and not by the next state in these specific cases. Here's the improved `reward_func`:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (TigerState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Define the reward based on the action and the state
    if action == TigerActions.OPEN_LEFT:
        if state.tiger_location == 0:  # Tiger is behind the left door
            reward = -1.0  # Opening the door with the tiger results in a negative reward
            done = True
        else:
            reward = 1.0  # Opening the door without the tiger results in a positive reward
            done = True
    elif action == TigerActions.OPEN_RIGHT:
        if state.tiger_location == 1:  # Tiger is behind the right door
            reward = -1.0  # Opening the door with the tiger results in a negative reward
            done = True
        else:
            reward = 1.0  # Opening the door without the tiger results in a positive reward
            done = True
    elif action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        reward = 0.0  # Listening does not provide a reward, but the episode continues
        done = False
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown action: {action}")

    return reward, done
```

### Explanation
- **OPEN_LEFT Action**: 
  - If the tiger is behind the left door (`state.tiger_location == 0`), the reward is -1.0 regardless of the next state.
  - If the tiger is behind the right door (`state.tiger_location == 1`), the reward is 1.0.
- **OPEN_RIGHT Action**: 
  - If the tiger is behind the right door (`state.tiger_location == 1`), the reward is -1.0 regardless of the next state.
  - If the tiger is behind the left door (`state.tiger_location == 0`), the reward is 1.0.
- **LISTEN Action**: The reward is always 0.0, and the episode continues.

This ensures that the reward is correctly conditioned on the current state and action, and not influenced by the next state in cases where it should not be.
