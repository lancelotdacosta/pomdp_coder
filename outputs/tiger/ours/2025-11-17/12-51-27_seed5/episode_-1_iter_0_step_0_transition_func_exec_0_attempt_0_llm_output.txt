Based on the provided samples, it appears that the environment transitions are as follows:

- If the action is `LISTEN` (2), the state does not change.
- If the action is `OPEN_LEFT` (0) or `OPEN_RIGHT` (1), the state remains the same.

Given this, the distribution of next states conditioned on actions and previous states can be described as:
- For `LISTEN` action, the next state is always the same as the current state.
- For `OPEN_LEFT` or `OPEN_RIGHT` actions, the next state is also the same as the current state.

Here is the implementation of the `transition_func` function:

```python
def transition_func(state, action):
    """
    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment 
        action (int): action to be taken in state `state`
    Returns:
        new_state (TigerState): the new state of the environment
    """
    # If the action is LISTEN, the state does not change
    if action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        return state
    
    # For OPEN_LEFT and OPEN_RIGHT actions, the state remains the same
    return state
```
