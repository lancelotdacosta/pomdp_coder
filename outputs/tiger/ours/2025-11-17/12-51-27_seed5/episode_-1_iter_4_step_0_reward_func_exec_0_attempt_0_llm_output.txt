Based on the provided observations, it seems that the reward model has a small probability of providing a different reward than the expected one. Specifically, when opening the door with the tiger, there is a small chance of getting a less severe negative reward, and when opening the door without the tiger, there is a small chance of getting a smaller positive reward.

Let's improve the `reward_func` to better match the observed distribution:

1. When the agent opens the door with the tiger, there is a 95% chance of receiving -100.0 and a 5% chance of receiving -1.0.
2. When the agent opens the door without the tiger, there is a 95% chance of receiving 10.0 and a 5% chance of receiving 1.0.
3. The `LISTEN` action should always result in a reward of 0.0 and no termination.

Here is the improved `reward_func`:

```python
def reward_func(state: TigerState, action: int, next_state: TigerState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (TigerState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Define the reward based on the state-action-next_state transition
    if action == TigerActions.OPEN_LEFT:
        if state.tiger_location == 0:
            # Opening the door with the tiger results in a large negative reward
            if random.random() < 0.95:  # 95% chance of -100.0
                return -100.0, True
            else:  # 5% chance of -1.0
                return -1.0, True
        else:
            if random.random() < 0.95:  # 95% chance of 10.0
                return 10.0, True
            else:  # 5% chance of 1.0
                return 1.0, True
    elif action == TigerActions.OPEN_RIGHT:
        if state.tiger_location == 1:
            # Opening the door with the tiger results in a large negative reward
            if random.random() < 0.95:  # 95% chance of -100.0
                return -100.0, True
            else:  # 5% chance of -1.0
                return -1.0, True
        else:
            if random.random() < 0.95:  # 95% chance of 10.0
                return 10.0, True
            else:  # 5% chance of 1.0
                return 1.0, True
    elif action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        return 0.0, False  # Listening does not change the state and provides no immediate reward

    # Default case (should not happen in a well-defined environment)
    return 0.0, False
```

This function should now more accurately reflect the true distribution of rewards based on the provided observations. The probabilities for the rewards are correctly set to match the given scenarios.
