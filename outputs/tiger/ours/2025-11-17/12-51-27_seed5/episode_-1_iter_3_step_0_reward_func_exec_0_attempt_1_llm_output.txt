It looks like the `enum` module is not being imported correctly. To fix this, you need to ensure that the `enum` module is imported at the beginning of your script. Here is the corrected code with the necessary import statement:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import random
import enum
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

# Define the actions and states
class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState:
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def reward_func(state: TigerState, action: int, next_state: TigerState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (TigerState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Define the reward based on the state-action-next_state transition
    if action == TigerActions.OPEN_LEFT:
        if state.tiger_location == 0:
            # Opening the door with the tiger results in a large negative reward
            if random.random() < 0.95:  # 95% chance of -100.0
                return -100.0, True
            else:  # 5% chance of -1.0
                return -1.0, True
        else:
            if random.random() < 0.95:  # 95% chance of 10.0
                return 10.0, True
            else:  # 5% chance of 1.0
                return 1.0, True
    elif action == TigerActions.OPEN_RIGHT:
        if state.tiger_location == 1:
            # Opening the door with the tiger results in a large negative reward
            if random.random() < 0.95:  # 95% chance of -100.0
                return -100.0, True
            else:  # 5% chance of -1.0
                return -1.0, True
        else:
            if random.random() < 0.95:  # 95% chance of 10.0
                return 10.0, True
            else:  # 5% chance of 1.0
                return 1.0, True
    elif action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        return 0.0, False  # Listening does not change the state and provides no immediate reward

    # Default case (should not happen in a well-defined environment)
    return 0.0, False
```

This code now correctly imports the `enum` module, ensuring that the `TigerActions` class is defined properly. This should resolve the `NameError` you encountered.
