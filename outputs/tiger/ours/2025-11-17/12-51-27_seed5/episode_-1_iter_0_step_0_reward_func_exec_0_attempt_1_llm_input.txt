You are a robot exploring its environment. 

Environment Description: 
Goal Description: 

Your goal is to model the the reward conditioned on state, action, next state transition. 
You need to implement the python code to model the world, as seen in the provided experiences. 
Please follow the template to implement the code. 
The code needs to be directly runnable (state, action, next_state) and return (reward, done). 


Below are a few samples from the environment distribution. These are only samples from a larger distribution that your should model.

Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Input int: 1
Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Output float: 1.0
Output bool: True


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Input int: 2
Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Output float: 0.0
Output bool: False


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Input int: 2
Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Output float: 0.0
Output bool: False


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Output float: 0.0
Output bool: False


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Input int: 2
Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Output float: 0.0
Output bool: False




Here is the template for the reward_func function. Please implement
the reward function following the template. The code needs to be directly
runnable.

### Explanation of the Reward Function

The reward function is designed to encourage the agent to make optimal decisions in the Tiger problem. Here's what the reward function does:

1. **Opening the Left Door (`OPEN_LEFT`)**:
   - If the tiger is behind the left door, the agent receives a large negative reward (-100.0) and the episode ends.
   - If the tiger is behind the right door, the agent receives a positive reward (10.0) and the episode ends.

2. **Opening the Right Door (`OPEN_RIGHT`)**:
   - If the tiger is behind the right door, the agent receives a large negative reward (-100.0) and the episode ends.
   - If the tiger is behind the left door, the agent receives a positive reward (10.0) and the episode ends.

3. **Listening (`LISTEN`)**:
   - Listening does not change the state of the environment and provides no immediate reward. The episode continues.

The function ensures that the agent learns to avoid opening the door with the tiger behind it and to open the correct door for a positive reward. The listening action allows the agent to gather more information without incurring a penalty.
