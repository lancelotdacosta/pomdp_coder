Certainly! Let's analyze the issue and then improve the `reward_func` function.

### Analysis

From the provided examples, it seems that there are some special cases where the reward is `1.0` instead of the expected large penalty or reward. These special cases seem to occur when the action results in an unexpected transition (e.g., the tiger location changes).

### Reward Function Explanation

The reward function should be based on the following conditions:
- **Listening**: No immediate reward or penalty.
- **Opening a door with the tiger behind it**: Large penalty (`-100.0`).
- **Opening a door without the tiger behind it**: Large reward (`10.0`).
- **Special cases**: If the tiger location changes in an unexpected way, a small reward (`1.0`) is given.

### Improved `reward_func` Function

Here is the improved `reward_func` function:

```python
def reward_func(state: TigerState, action: int, next_state: TigerState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (TigerState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Define the reward based on the actions and the state transitions
    if action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        # Listening does not provide any immediate reward or penalty
        reward = 0.0
        done = False
    elif action == TigerActions.OPEN_LEFT:
        if state.tiger_location == 0:  # Tiger is behind the left door
            # Opening the left door when the tiger is behind it results in a large penalty
            reward = -100.0
            done = True
        elif state.tiger_location == 1 and next_state.tiger_location == 0:  # Special case
            reward = 1.0
            done = True
        else:
            # Opening the left door when the tiger is behind the right door results in a large reward
            reward = 10.0
            done = True
    elif action == TigerActions.OPEN_RIGHT:
        if state.tiger_location == 1:  # Tiger is behind the right door
            # Opening the right door when the tiger is behind it results in a large penalty
            reward = -100.0
            done = True
        elif state.tiger_location == 0 and next_state.tiger_location == 1:  # Special case
            reward = 1.0
            done = True
        else:
            # Opening the right door when the tiger is behind the left door results in a large reward
            reward = 10.0
            done = True
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown action: {action}")

    # Handle special cases where the tiger location changes unexpectedly
    if state.tiger_location != next_state.tiger_location:
        reward = 1.0

    return reward, done
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Special Cases Handling**: Added a check at the end to handle cases where the tiger location changes unexpectedly. If the tiger location changes, a small reward (`1.0`) is given.
2. **Generalized Conditions**: Ensured that the conditions for large penalties and rewards are correctly applied.

This should better model the true distribution based on the provided examples.
