Based on the provided samples, it seems that there is an additional reward structure or conditional logic that is not captured in the current implementation. Specifically, when the agent opens the door with the tiger, the reward is -100.0, and when the agent opens the correct door, the reward is 10.0. However, there are cases where opening the wrong door results in a smaller negative reward of 1.0 instead of -100.0.

To better model this, we need to account for the possibility of a smaller negative reward in certain scenarios. One plausible explanation is that the environment might have a small chance of providing a less severe penalty even when the wrong door is opened. This can be modeled by introducing a probability factor for the smaller negative reward.

Here is the improved `reward_func` function:

```python
def reward_func(state: TigerState, action: int, next_state: TigerState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (TigerState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Define the reward based on the state-action-next_state transition
    if action == TigerActions.OPEN_LEFT:
        if state.tiger_location == 0:
            # Opening the door with the tiger results in a large negative reward
            if random.random() < 0.95:  # 95% chance of -100.0
                return -100.0, True
            else:  # 5% chance of -1.0
                return -1.0, True
        else:
            return 10.0, True  # Opening the correct door results in a positive reward
    elif action == TigerActions.OPEN_RIGHT:
        if state.tiger_location == 1:
            # Opening the door with the tiger results in a large negative reward
            if random.random() < 0.95:  # 95% chance of -100.0
                return -100.0, True
            else:  # 5% chance of -1.0
                return -1.0, True
        else:
            return 10.0, True  # Opening the correct door results in a positive reward
    elif action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        return 0.0, False  # Listening does not change the state and provides no immediate reward

    # Default case (should not happen in a well-defined environment)
    return 0.0, False
```

This function introduces a small probability (5%) of receiving a smaller negative reward (-1.0) when the agent opens the door with the tiger, which aligns with the observed real-world samples. The rest of the behavior remains the same as the previous implementation.
