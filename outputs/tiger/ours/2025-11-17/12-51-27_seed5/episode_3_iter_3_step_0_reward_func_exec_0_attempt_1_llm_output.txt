It looks like the issue is with the syntax used in the `TigerObservationEnum` class. The `enum.IntEnum` should not have commas between the assignments. Let's correct that and ensure the `reward_func` function is properly defined.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import enum
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

# Existing classes and enums
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0
    HEAR_RIGHT = 1
    NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int  # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def reward_func(state: TigerState, action: int, next_state: TigerState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (TigerState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    if action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        reward = 0.0
        done = False
    elif action == TigerActions.OPEN_LEFT:
        if state.tiger_location == 0:  # Tiger is behind the left door
            reward = -100.0
            done = True
        elif state.tiger_location == 1 and next_state.tiger_location == 0:  # Special case
            reward = 1.0
            done = True
        else:
            reward = 10.0
            done = True
    elif action == TigerActions.OPEN_RIGHT:
        if state.tiger_location == 1:  # Tiger is behind the right door
            reward = -100.0
            done = True
        elif state.tiger_location == 0 and next_state.tiger_location == 1:  # Special case
            reward = 1.0
            done = True
        else:
            reward = 10.0
            done = True
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown action: {action}")

    return reward, done
```

The `TigerObservationEnum` class now uses the correct syntax for defining enum values. This should resolve the syntax error and allow the code to compile and run correctly.
