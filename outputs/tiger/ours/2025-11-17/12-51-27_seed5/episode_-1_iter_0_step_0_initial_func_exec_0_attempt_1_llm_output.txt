It appears that the `enum` module is not being recognized because it was not imported. To fix this, we need to import the `enum` module at the beginning of the code.

Here is the corrected implementation of the `initial_func` function with the necessary import:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import random
import enum
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

from uncertain_worms.structs import (
    Environment,
    Heuristic,
    InitialModel,
    Observation,
    ObservationModel,
    RewardModel,
    State,
    TransitionModel,
)

# --------------------------- Enums & Dataclasses -----------------------------#
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0
    HEAR_RIGHT = 1
    NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def initial_func(empty_state: TigerState) -> TigerState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (TigerState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (TigerState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Assuming a uniform distribution for simplicity
    tiger_location = random.choice([0, 1])
    return TigerState(tiger_location=tiger_location)
```

This should resolve the `NameError` and ensure that the `enum` module is properly recognized. The function will now correctly return a `TigerState` with the tiger location randomly set to either LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1).
