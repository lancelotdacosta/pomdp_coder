The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `TigerState` is a dataclass and does not have class-level attributes like `LEFT` or `RIGHT`. Instead, you should use the integer values directly to compare the tiger's location.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `reward_func`:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (TigerState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Define the reward based on the actions and the state transitions
    if action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        # Listening does not provide any immediate reward or penalty
        reward = 0.0
        done = False
    elif action == TigerActions.OPEN_LEFT:
        if state.tiger_location == 0:  # Tiger is behind the left door
            # Opening the left door when the tiger is behind it results in a large penalty
            reward = -100.0
            done = True
        else:
            # Opening the left door when the tiger is behind the right door results in a large reward
            reward = 10.0
            done = True
    elif action == TigerActions.OPEN_RIGHT:
        if state.tiger_location == 1:  # Tiger is behind the right door
            # Opening the right door when the tiger is behind it results in a large penalty
            reward = -100.0
            done = True
        else:
            # Opening the right door when the tiger is behind the left door results in a large reward
            reward = 10.0
            done = True
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown action: {action}")

    return reward, done
```

In this corrected version, I replaced `TigerState.LEFT` and `TigerState.RIGHT` with the integer values `0` and `1` respectively, as these are the values used to represent the tiger's location in the `TigerState` dataclass. This should resolve the `AttributeError` you encountered.
