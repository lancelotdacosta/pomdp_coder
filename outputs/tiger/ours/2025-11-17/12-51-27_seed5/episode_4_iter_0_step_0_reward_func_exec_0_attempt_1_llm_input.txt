#define system
You are a robot exploring its environment. 

Environment Description: 
Goal Description: 

Your goal is to model the the reward conditioned on state, action, next state transition. 
You need to implement the python code to model the world, as seen in the provided experiences. 
Please follow the template to implement the code. 
The code needs to be directly runnable (state, action, next_state) and return (reward, done). 


Below are a few samples from the environment distribution. These are only samples from a larger distribution that your should model.

Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Output float: 0.0
Output bool: False


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Output float: 0.0
Output bool: False


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 0
Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Output float: 1.0
Output bool: True


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Output float: 0.0
Output bool: False


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Output float: 0.0
Output bool: False




Here is the template for the reward_func function. Please implement
the reward function following the template. The code needs to be directly
runnable.

Explain what you believe is the the reward conditioned on state, action, next state transition in english.
Additionally, please implement code to model the logic of the world. Please implement the 
code following the template. Only output the definition for ‘ reward_func ‘. 
You must implement the ‘ reward_func ‘ function.
Create any helper function inside the scope of ‘ reward_func ‘. 
Do not create any helper function outside the scope of ‘ reward_func ‘.
Do not output examples usage. 
Do not create any new classes.
Do not rewrite existing classes. 
Do not import any new modules from anywhere.
Do not overfit to the specific samples.
Put the ‘ reward_func ‘ function in a python code block.

### Explanation of the Reward Function

The reward function is designed based on the logic of the Tiger problem:

1. **Opening the Door with the Tiger**: If the agent opens the door where the tiger is located (either LEFT or RIGHT), it receives a negative reward of -1.0 and the episode ends (`done = True`).

2. **Opening the Door without the Tiger**: If the agent opens the door where the tiger is not located, it receives a positive reward of 1.0 and the episode ends (`done = True`).

3. **Listening**: If the agent chooses to listen, it receives no immediate reward (0.0) and the episode continues (`done = False`).

This reward structure encourages the agent to avoid opening the door with the tiger while trying to find the door without the tiger, and it provides the option to gather more information by listening without any immediate cost.
