Based on the provided samples, it seems that the reward function should account for cases where the state does not change after an action is taken. Specifically, there are scenarios where the environment remains in the same state and the episode terminates with a reward of 0.0.

Here's the improved `reward_func` function:

```python
def reward_func(state: TigerState, action: int, next_state: TigerState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (TigerState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Define the reward based on the action and the state
    if action == TigerActions.OPEN_LEFT:
        if state.tiger_location == 0:  # Tiger is behind the left door
            reward = -1.0  # Opening the door with the tiger results in a negative reward
            done = True
        else:
            reward = 1.0  # Opening the door without the tiger results in a positive reward
            done = True
    elif action == TigerActions.OPEN_RIGHT:
        if state.tiger_location == 1:  # Tiger is behind the right door
            reward = -1.0  # Opening the door with the tiger results in a negative reward
            done = True
        else:
            reward = 1.0  # Opening the door without the tiger results in a positive reward
            done = True
    elif action == TigerActions.LISTEN:
        if next_state == state:  # No change in state after listening
            reward = 0.0  # Listening does not provide a reward, but the episode continues
            done = False
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unexpected next state after listening action")
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown action: {action}")

    return reward, done
```

This function now includes a check for the `LISTEN` action where the state remains unchanged. If the state does not change after listening, the reward is 0.0 and the episode continues. This should better model the observed distribution from the real world.
