You are a robot exploring its environment. 

Environment Description: 
Goal Description: 

Your goal is to model the the distribution of observations conditioned on a state. 
You need to implement the python code to model the world, as seen in the provided experiences. 
Please follow the template to implement the code. 
The code needs to be directly runnable (state) and return a sample (observation). 


Below are a few samples from the environment distribution. These are only samples from a larger distribution that your should model.

Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=1)


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=1)


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=1)


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=RIGHT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=1)


Input TigerState: TigerState(tiger_location=LEFT)
Input int: 2
Output TigerObservation: TigerObservation(obs=0)




Here is the template for the observation_func function. Please implement
the reward function following the template. The code needs to be directly
runnable.

### Explanation of the Distribution of Observations Conditioned on a State

The agent can take three actions: `OPEN_LEFT`, `OPEN_RIGHT`, and `LISTEN`. The observation function is only relevant when the agent chooses to `LISTEN`.

When the agent listens, it will hear the tiger's growl from the correct side (left or right) with a high probability (0.85). There is a small probability (0.15) that the agent will hear the tiger from the incorrect side.

- If the tiger is on the left (`TigerState.LEFT`):
  - With a probability of 0.85, the agent will hear the tiger from the left.
  - With a probability of 0.15, the agent will hear the tiger from the right.

- If the tiger is on the right (`TigerState.RIGHT`):
  - With a probability of 0.85, the agent will hear the tiger from the right.
  - With a probability of 0.15, the agent will hear the tiger from the left.

This distribution models the uncertainty in the agent's perception, which is a common scenario in partially observable environments.

SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Maybe you meant '==' or ':=' instead of '='?

#define assistant
The error you're encountering is due to a syntax issue in the definition of the `TigerObservationEnum` class. The correct way to define an enum with multiple values is to use commas to separate the values, but not to use commas at the end of each value. Here's the corrected version of the code:

    obs: int  # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""

        else:
            return TigerObservation(obs=TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_LEFT)
```

### Explanation of the Change

- **Corrected Enum Definition**: The `TigerObservationEnum` class now correctly defines the enum values without commas at the end of each value. This is the correct syntax for defining enums in Python.

This should resolve the `SyntaxError` and allow your code to compile and run correctly.
