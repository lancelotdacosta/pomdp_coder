The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `TigerState` is a dataclass and does not have class-level attributes like `LEFT` or `RIGHT`. Instead, the `tiger_location` attribute of a `TigerState` instance should be used directly.

Here's the corrected version of the `observation_func` function:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import copy
import enum
import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

from uncertain_worms.structs import (
    Environment,
    Heuristic,
    InitialModel,
    Observation,
    ObservationModel,
    RewardModel,
    State,
    TransitionModel,
)


# --------------------------- Enums & Dataclasses -----------------------------#
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0
    HEAR_RIGHT = 1
    NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int  # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def observation_func(state: TigerState, action: int, empty_obs: TigerObservation) -> TigerObservation:
    """
    Represents the non-centered field of view of the agent.

    The observation represents the agent's relative view of the world. 

    The agent is NOT in the center of the observation grid.

    Observation grids are always square-sizes (i.e. 3x3, 5x5, 7x7).

    The width and height of the observation grid are called view size.

    The agent is ALWAYS at obs.image[view_size // 2, view_size - 1] in the observation `image`

    Your may make use of the state.get_field_of_view helper function.

    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the previous action that was taken
        empty_obs (TigerObservation): an empty observation that needs to be filled and returned
    Returns:
        obs (TigerObservation): observation of the agent
    """
    if action != TigerActions.LISTEN:
        return empty_obs

    # Probability of hearing the correct side when the tiger is on a specific side
    correct_hear_prob = 0.85
    incorrect_hear_prob = 1 - correct_hear_prob

    if state.tiger_location == 0:  # Tiger is on the left
        if random.random() < correct_hear_prob:
            return TigerObservation(obs=TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_LEFT)
        else:
            return TigerObservation(obs=TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_RIGHT)
    else:  # Tiger is on the right
        if random.random() < correct_hear_prob:
            return TigerObservation(obs=TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_RIGHT)
        else:
            return TigerObservation(obs=TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_LEFT)
```

### Explanation of the Change

- **Direct Use of `tiger_location`**: Instead of comparing `state.tiger_location` to `TigerState.LEFT` or `TigerState.RIGHT`, we directly compare it to the integer values `0` and `1`. This is because `tiger_location` is defined as an integer in the `TigerState` dataclass.

This should resolve the `AttributeError` and allow your code to run correctly.
