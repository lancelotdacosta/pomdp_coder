The error you're encountering is due to a syntax issue in the definition of the `TigerObservationEnum` class. The correct way to define an enum with multiple values is to use commas to separate the values, but not to use commas at the end of each value. Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import copy
import enum
import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

from uncertain_worms.structs import (
    Environment,
    Heuristic,
    InitialModel,
    Observation,
    ObservationModel,
    RewardModel,
    State,
    TransitionModel,
)


# --------------------------- Enums & Dataclasses -----------------------------#
class TigerObservationEnum(enum.IntEnum):
    """Possible observations the agent can receive."""
    HEAR_LEFT = 0
    HEAR_RIGHT = 1
    NONE = 2

class TigerActions(enum.IntEnum):
    """Agent actions in the classic Tiger problem."""
    OPEN_LEFT = 0
    OPEN_RIGHT = 1
    LISTEN = 2

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerObservation(Observation):
    """Observation dataclass."""
    obs: int  # 0 = hear left, 1 = hear right, 2 = none

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TigerState(State):
    """Underlying hidden state: tiger behind LEFT (0) or RIGHT (1) door."""
    tiger_location: int  # 0 = left, 1 = right

def observation_func(state: TigerState, action: int, empty_obs: TigerObservation) -> TigerObservation:
    """
    Represents the non-centered field of view of the agent.

    The observation represents the agent's relative view of the world. 

    The agent is NOT in the center of the observation grid.

    Observation grids are always square-sizes (i.e. 3x3, 5x5, 7x7).

    The width and height of the observation grid are called view size.

    The agent is ALWAYS at obs.image[view_size // 2, view_size - 1] in the observation `image`

    Your may make use of the state.get_field_of_view helper function.

    Args:
        state (TigerState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the previous action that was taken
        empty_obs (TigerObservation): an empty observation that needs to be filled and returned
    Returns:
        obs (TigerObservation): observation of the agent
    """
    if action != TigerActions.LISTEN:
        return empty_obs

    # Probability of hearing the correct side when the tiger is on a specific side
    correct_hear_prob = 0.85
    incorrect_hear_prob = 1 - correct_hear_prob

    if state.tiger_location == TigerState.LEFT:
        if random.random() < correct_hear_prob:
            return TigerObservation(obs=TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_LEFT)
        else:
            return TigerObservation(obs=TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_RIGHT)
    else:  # state.tiger_location == TigerState.RIGHT
        if random.random() < correct_hear_prob:
            return TigerObservation(obs=TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_RIGHT)
        else:
            return TigerObservation(obs=TigerObservationEnum.HEAR_LEFT)
```

### Explanation of the Change

- **Corrected Enum Definition**: The `TigerObservationEnum` class now correctly defines the enum values without commas at the end of each value. This is the correct syntax for defining enums in Python.

This should resolve the `SyntaxError` and allow your code to compile and run correctly.
