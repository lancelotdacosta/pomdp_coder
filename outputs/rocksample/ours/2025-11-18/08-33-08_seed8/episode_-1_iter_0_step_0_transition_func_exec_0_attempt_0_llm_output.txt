### Explanation

1. **Move Actions**:
   - `MOVE_NORTH`: Moves the agent one step north (decreases y-coordinate).
   - `MOVE_SOUTH`: Moves the agent one step south (increases y-coordinate).
   - `MOVE_EAST`: Moves the agent one step east (increases x-coordinate).
   - `MOVE_WEST`: Moves the agent one step west (decreases x-coordinate).

2. **Sample Action**:
   - `SAMPLE`: If the agent is at a rock's position, it samples the rock and marks it as good. The state of the rock is updated accordingly.

3. **Exit Action**:
   - `EXIT`: The exit action does not change the state of the environment.

4. **Check Rock Actions**:
   - `CHECK_ROCK_0`, `CHECK_ROCK_1`: These actions do not change the state but are used to inspect rocks. They are handled separately in the observation function, which is not covered in this transition function.

The transition function ensures that the agent's position is constrained within the grid boundaries and updates the rock states when sampled.
