Based on the observed samples from the real world and the discrepancies with the generated model, it appears that the distribution of initial states is broader than initially assumed. Specifically, the following observations can be made:

1. **Agent Positions**: The agent's initial positions are not limited to the provided `possible_positions` list. The observed samples include positions `(2, 1)`, `(1, 4)`, and `(0, 0)` which were not included in the original list.

2. **Rock States**: The rock states `[B, G]` and `[B, B]` are present in the observed samples, but the original code did not generate these states consistently.

To better model the true distribution, we need to expand the possible initial positions for the agent and include all possible combinations of rock states. Here is the improved `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: RockSampleState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (RockSampleState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (RockSampleState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Expanded possible initial positions for the agent
    possible_positions = [
        (2, 4), (1, 2), (0, 4), (4, 0),  # original positions
        (2, 1), (1, 4), (0, 0)           # new positions from observed samples
    ]
    
    # All possible rock states
    possible_rock_states = [
        (False, False),  # [B, B]
        (False, True),   # [B, G]
        (True, False),   # [G, B]
        (True, True)     # [G, G]
    ]
    
    # Randomly select an initial position for the agent
    x, y = random.choice(possible_positions)
    
    # Randomly select an initial state for the rocks
    rocks = random.choice(possible_rock_states)
    
    # Create and return the initial state
    initial_state = RockSampleState(x=x, y=y, rocks=rocks)
    return initial_state
```

This updated function now includes all observed positions and rock states, making the distribution of initial states more aligned with the real-world samples.
