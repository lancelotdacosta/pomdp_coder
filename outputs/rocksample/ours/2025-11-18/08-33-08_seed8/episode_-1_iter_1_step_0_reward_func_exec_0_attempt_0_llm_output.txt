Certainly! Let's analyze the discrepancies between the real world samples and your current model.

### Analysis
1. **Checking Actions (CHECK_ROCK_0, CHECK_ROCK_1):**
   - In the real world, checking a rock results in a reward of `-1.0` if the rock status changes after the action. This suggests that the check action might have a side effect of changing the rock's status.
   - In your current model, the reward is `0.0` if the rock status does not change, which is incorrect for the real world.

2. ** Sampling Action (SAMPLE):**
   - In the real world, sampling a rock at the correct position results in a reward of `10.0` and the episode ends.
   - In your current model, the reward is `0.0` for sampling, even if the rock is good.

3. ** Exit Action (EXIT):**
   - In the real world, the exit action results in a reward of `10.0` if the agent is at a specific position and the episode ends.
   - In your current model, the exit action does not provide any reward.

### Improved Reward Function
Based on the analysis, we need to update the reward function to better match the real-world behavior.

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    
    # Reward for checking a rock
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        rock_idx = CHECK_ACTIONS.index(action)
        if state.rocks[rock_idx] != next_state.rocks[rock_idx]:
            return -1.0, False
        else:
            return 0.0, False

    # Reward for sampling a rock
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None and next_state.rocks[rock_idx]:
            return 10.0, True
        else:
            return 0.0, False

    # Reward for exit action
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        if (state.x, state.y) in ROCK_POSITIONS:
            return 10.0, True
        else:
            return 0.0, True

    # No reward for movement actions
    if action in [RockSampleActions.MOVE_NORTH, RockSampleActions.MOVE_SOUTH, RockSampleActions.MOVE_EAST, RockSampleActions.MOVE_WEST]:
        return 0.0, False

    # Default case (should not happen)
    return 0.0, False
```

### Explanation
1. **Checking Actions:**
   - If the rock status changes after the check action, the reward is `-1.0`.
   - If the rock status does not change, the reward is `0.0`.

2. **Sampling Action:**
   - If the agent samples a rock at the correct position and the rock is good, the reward is `10.0` and the episode ends.
   - Otherwise, the reward is `0.0`.

3. **Exit Action:**
   - If the agent exits from any of the rock positions, the reward is `10.0` and the episode ends.
   - Otherwise, the reward is `0.0` and the episode ends.

This updated reward function should better reflect the real-world behavior as observed in the samples.
