Based on the provided samples, the distribution of initial states appears to have the following characteristics:

1. **Agent Position (x, y):** The agent can start at different positions within the grid. The positions provided in the samples are:
   - (2, 4)
   - (1, 2)
   - (0, 4)
   - (4, 0)

2. **Rock States:** There are two rocks, and each rock can be either `GOOD` (G) or `BAD` (B). The samples show different combinations of rock states:
   - [B, G]
   - [G, B]
   - [G, G]

Given this information, the distribution of initial states can be modeled as follows:

- The agent's position is uniformly distributed among the provided positions.
- The rock states are also uniformly distributed among the observed combinations.

Here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: RockSampleState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (RockSampleState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (RockSampleState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Possible initial positions for the agent
    possible_positions = [(2, 4), (1, 2), (0, 4), (4, 0)]
    
    # Possible rock states
    possible_rock_states = [
        (False, True),  # [B, G]
        (True, False),  # [G, B]
        (True, True)    # [G, G]
    ]
    
    # Randomly select an initial position for the agent
    x, y = random.choice(possible_positions)
    
    # Randomly select an initial state for the rocks
    rocks = random.choice(possible_rock_states)
    
    # Create and return the initial state
    initial_state = RockSampleState(x=x, y=y, rocks=rocks)
    return initial_state
```

This function will generate a sample initial state by randomly selecting from the provided positions and rock states. This ensures that the distribution of initial states is consistent with the samples provided.
