Based on the provided samples, it appears that the initial state distribution for the RockSample problem can be described as follows:

1. The agent's starting position `(x, y)` is uniformly distributed across the grid, with the exception of the rock positions and possibly the walls.
2. The rocks' states (good or bad) are also uniformly distributed, with each rock having an equal probability of being good or bad.

Given this understanding, we can implement the `initial_func` function to sample from this distribution.

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: RockSampleState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (RockSampleState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (RockSampleState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    
    # Define the possible positions for the agent
    possible_positions = [(x, y) for x in range(GRID_SIZE) for y in range(GRID_SIZE)]
    # Remove rock positions and wall positions (if any)
    possible_positions = [pos for pos in possible_positions if pos not in ROCK_POSITIONS]
    
    # Sample a random position for the agent
    x, y = random.choice(possible_positions)
    
    # Sample the states of the rocks (good or bad)
    rocks = tuple(random.choice([True, False]) for _ in range(NUM_ROCKS))
    
    # Create and return the initial state
    return RockSampleState(x=x, y=y, rocks=rocks)
```

This function first defines the possible positions for the agent by excluding the rock positions. It then samples a random position for the agent and randomly assigns good or bad states to each rock. Finally, it creates and returns the initial state with the sampled values.
