Based on the provided samples, it seems that the distribution of initial states in the RockSample environment is characterized by:

1. The agent's starting position (x, y) can be any valid cell within the grid (0-4, 0-4), excluding the walls.
2. The rocks are always at fixed positions as defined in `ROCK_POSITIONS`.
3. The quality of each rock (good or bad) is equally likely and independent of the agent's starting position.

Given this understanding, here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: RockSampleState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (RockSampleState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (RockSampleState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Generate a random valid position for the agent within the grid
    x = random.randint(0, GRID_SIZE - 1)
    y = random.randint(0, GRID_SIZE - 1)

    # Ensure the agent does not start on a rock position
    while (x, y) in ROCK_POSITIONS:
        x = random.randint(0, GRID_SIZE - 1)
        y = random.randint(0, GRID_SIZE - 1)

    # Generate the quality of each rock (good or bad) independently
    rocks = tuple(random.choice([True, False]) for _ in range(NUM_ROCKS))

    # Create and return the initial state
    state = RockSampleState(x=x, y=y, rocks=rocks)
    return state
```

This function ensures that the agent's starting position is randomly chosen from valid grid cells, excluding rock positions. The quality of each rock is also randomly determined as either good or bad. This approach avoids overfitting to the specific samples and models the distribution of initial states as described.
