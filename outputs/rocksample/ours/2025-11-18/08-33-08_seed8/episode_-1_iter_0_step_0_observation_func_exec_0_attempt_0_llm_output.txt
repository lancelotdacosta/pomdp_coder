    Represents the non-centered field of view of the agent.

    The observation represents the agent's relative view of the world. 

    The agent is NOT in the center of the observation grid.

    Observation grids are always square-sizes (i.e. 3x3, 5x5, 7x7).

    The width and height of the observation grid are called view size.

    The agent is ALWAYS at obs.image[view_size // 2, view_size - 1] in the observation `image`

    Your may make use of the state.get_field_of_view helper function.

    Args:

        action (int): the previous action that was taken

### Explanation of the Observation Distribution

The observation distribution is conditioned on the state and the action taken by the agent. Here's how it works:

1. **Agent Position**: The observation always includes the agent's current position `(x, y)`.

2. **Rock Check Actions**:
   - If the agent performs a `CHECK_ROCK` action (e.g., `CHECK_ROCK_0` or `CHECK_ROCK_1`), the observation will provide a noisy reading of the rock status.
   - The rock status is determined by the `rocks` tuple in the state. For example, if the rock at index 0 is good (`True`), the agent will usually receive a `GOOD` reading.
   - However, there is a 10% chance that the reading is noisy and incorrect. This introduces uncertainty into the observation.

3. **Other Actions**:
   - For all other actions (e.g., moving, exiting), the observation will return `NULL` for both `rock_idx` and `is_good`.

4. **Rocks at Agent's Position**:
   - The function checks if the agent is at a rock position using the `at_rock` method. If the agent is at a rock and performs a `CHECK_ROCK` action for that rock, it will get a reading.
   - If the agent is not at a rock or performs a `CHECK_ROCK` action for a different rock, the observation will return `NULL`.

This distribution ensures that the agent can get useful but noisy information about the rocks when checking them, while other actions do not provide additional information.
