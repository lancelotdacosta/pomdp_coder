Based on the discrepancies observed between the real world samples and the generated model, it seems there are issues with how the `EXIT` action is being handled. Specifically, the reward and the `done` flag should only be set when the agent exits at a rock. However, in the current implementation, the `done` flag is always set to `True` when the `EXIT` action is taken, regardless of the agent's position.

To improve the `reward_func` function, we need to ensure that:

1. The `done` flag is set to `True` only when the `EXIT` action is taken.
2. The reward for the `EXIT` action is determined based on whether the agent is at a rock or not.
3. The reward for sampling a rock is correctly assigned based on the rock's quality (good or bad).

Here is the improved `reward_func` function:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    reward = 0.0
    done = False

    # Check if the agent is at a rock and samples it
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            if state.rocks[rock_idx]:  # Good rock
                reward = 10.0
            else:  # Bad rock
                reward = -10.0
        else:
            reward = -10.0  # Sampling when not at a rock

    # Check if the agent exits the grid
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        done = True
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            if state.rocks[rock_idx]:  # Good rock
                reward = 10.0
            else:  # Bad rock
                reward = -10.0
        else:
            reward = 0.0  # Not at a rock

    # Check if the agent checks a rock
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        rock_idx = CHECK_ACTIONS.index(action)
        if (state.x, state.y) == ROCK_POSITIONS[rock_idx]:
            reward = -1.0  # Cost of checking a rock

    return reward, done
```

This improved function should better match the observed behavior from the real world samples. The key changes are:

1. The `done` flag is only set to `True` when the `EXIT` action is taken.
2. The reward for the `EXIT` action is determined based on whether the agent is at a rock or not.
3. The logic for sampling and checking rocks remains unchanged.
