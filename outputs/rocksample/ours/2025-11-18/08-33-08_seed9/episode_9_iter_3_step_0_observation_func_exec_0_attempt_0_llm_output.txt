Certainly! Let's first describe the distribution of observations conditioned on a state in plain English:

### Distribution of Observations:
1. **Position (x, y):**
   - The agent always observes its current position `(x, y)` regardless of the action taken.

2. **Rock Index and Reading:**
   - If the agent performs a `CHECK_ROCK` action (e.g., `CHECK_ROCK_0` or `CHECK_ROCK_1`), the observation will include the index of the rock being checked (either 0 or 1).
   - If the agent is at the position of the rock it is checking, the sensor reading will be either `True` (Good) or `False` (Bad). The sensor has a certain accuracy rate, which is typically 85%.
   - If the agent is not at the position of the rock it is checking, the sensor reading should be `None` because the sensor cannot provide a reading without being at the rock's position.

3. **Other Actions:**
   - For actions other than `CHECK_ROCK`, the observation will have `rock_idx` and `is_good` set to `None`.

### Improved `observation_func`:
The current implementation already captures most of these points correctly. However, there are a few improvements we can make to ensure that the sensor readings are only provided when the agent is at the correct rock position. Here is the improved function:

```python
def observation_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, empty_obs: RockSampleObservation) -> RockSampleObservation:
    """
    Represents the non-centered field of view of the agent.

    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the previous action that was taken
        empty_obs (RockSampleObservation): an empty observation that needs to be filled and returned
    Returns:
        obs (RockSampleObservation): observation of the agent
    """
    # Initialize the observation with the current position
    obs = RockSampleObservation(x=state.x, y=state.y, rock_idx=None, is_good=None)

    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        rock_idx = action - RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0  # Convert action to rock index
        obs.rock_idx = rock_idx  # Always set rock_idx for check actions
        if state.at_rock() == rock_idx:
            # If the agent is at the rock's position, provide a noisy reading
            is_good = state.rocks[rock_idx]
            if random.random() < 0.85:  # Assume 85% accuracy for the sensor
                obs.is_good = is_good
            else:
                obs.is_good = not is_good
        else:
            # If the agent is not at the rock's position, the reading should be None
            obs.is_good = None

    return obs
```

### Explanation of Improvements:
1. **Check Rock Position:**
   - The function now explicitly checks if the agent is at the position of the rock it is trying to check. If not, `obs.is_good` is set to `None`.
2. **Sensor Reading:**
   - The sensor reading is only provided when the agent is at the correct rock position, ensuring that the observation matches the real-world distribution.

This should better model the true distribution of observations conditioned on the state of the world.
