    Represents the non-centered field of view of the agent.

    The observation represents the agent's relative view of the world. 

    The agent is NOT in the center of the observation grid.

    Observation grids are always square-sizes (i.e. 3x3, 5x5, 7x7).

    The width and height of the observation grid are called view size.

    The agent is ALWAYS at obs.image[view_size // 2, view_size - 1] in the observation `image`

    Your may make use of the state.get_field_of_view helper function.

    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the previous action that was taken
        empty_obs (RockSampleObservation): an empty observation that needs to be filled and returned
    Returns:
        obs (RockSampleObservation): observation of the agent

### Explanation of the Observation Distribution

The observation distribution is conditioned on the current state and the action taken by the agent. Here's how it works:

1. **Agent Position**: The observation always includes the agent's current position `(x, y)`.

2. **Rock Check Actions**:
   - If the agent performs a `CHECK_ROCK` action (`CHECK_ROCK_0` or `CHECK_ROCK_1`), and the agent is at the corresponding rock position:
     - The observation includes the rock index (`rock_idx`).
     - The observation also includes a noisy reading of whether the rock is good (`is_good`).
     - The noise is added with a probability defined by `NOISE_PROBABILITY` (e.g., 0.1).
   - If the agent is not at the rock position when performing a `CHECK_ROCK` action, the observation remains `NULL`.

3. **Other Actions**:
   - For all other actions (e.g., moving, sampling, exiting), the observation remains `NULL`.

### Implementation Details

- The function `observation_func` initializes an observation with the agent's current position.
- It checks if the agent is at a rock position using the `at_rock` method.
- For `CHECK_ROCK` actions, it adds the rock index and a noisy reading of the rock's quality to the observation.
- For all other actions, the observation remains `NULL` (i.e., `rock_idx` and `is_good` are `None`).
