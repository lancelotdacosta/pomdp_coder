Certainly! Let's start by explaining the distribution of observations conditioned on a state in English, and then we'll improve the `observation_func` function accordingly.

### Explanation of the Observation Distribution

In the RockSample environment, the agent can perform several actions, including moving, sampling rocks, exiting, and checking rocks. The observations are primarily relevant when the agent performs a check action (`CHECK_ROCK_0` or `CHECK_ROCK_1`). 

For these check actions:
- If the agent is at a rock position and performs a check, it receives an observation of the rock being good or bad.
- The reading is noisy with a certain probability (e.g., 0.1), meaning there's a chance the observation will be incorrect.
- If the agent is not at the rock position but still performs a check, the observation for `is_good` should be `None`.

However, the current implementation has a flaw: it incorrectly sets `is_good` to `None` when the agent is not at the rock position, even though the action was a check action. This is inconsistent with the real-world samples provided.

### Improved `observation_func` Function

To better model the true distribution, we need to ensure that when the agent performs a check action, it always returns an observation, even if the agent is not at the rock position. The noisy reading should only apply if the agent is at the rock position.

Here's the improved `observation_func` function:

```python
def observation_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, empty_obs: RockSampleObservation) -> RockSampleObservation:
    """
    Represents the non-centered field of view of the agent.

    The observation represents the agent's relative view of the world. 

    The agent is NOT in the center of the observation grid.

    Observation grids are always square-sizes (i.e. 3x3, 5x5, 7x7).

    The width and height of the observation grid are called view size.

    The agent is ALWAYS at obs.image[view_size // 2, view_size - 1] in the observation `image`

    Your may make use of the state.get_field_of_view helper function.

    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the previous action that was taken
        empty_obs (RockSampleObservation): an empty observation that needs to be filled and returned
    Returns:
        obs (RockSampleObservation): observation of the agent
    """
    # Initialize the observation with the current position
    obs = RockSampleObservation(x=state.x, y=state.y, rock_idx=None, is_good=None)

    # Check if the agent is at a rock position
    rock_idx = state.at_rock()

    # Define the probability of a noisy reading (is_good)
    NOISE_PROBABILITY = 0.1

    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        rock_idx_to_check = action - RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0
        obs.rock_idx = rock_idx_to_check
        if rock_idx == rock_idx_to_check:
            # The agent is at the correct rock position and performed a check action
            is_good = state.rocks[rock_idx]

            # Add noise to the observation with a certain probability
            if random.random() < NOISE_PROBABILITY:
                obs.is_good = not is_good
            else:
                obs.is_good = is_good
        else:
            # The agent is not at the rock position, but still performs a check action
            # In this case, we return a random reading (with the same noise probability)
            if random.random() < NOISE_PROBABILITY:
                obs.is_good = True  # Randomly set to good
            else:
                obs.is_good = False  # Randomly set to bad
    else:
        # For all other actions, the observation is NULL
        pass

    return obs
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Observation Initialization**: The observation is initialized with the current position and `rock_idx` and `is_good` set to `None`.
2. **Check Actions**: If the action is a check action:
   - The `rock_idx_to_check` is determined.
   - The `obs.rock_idx` is set to this value.
   - If the agent is at the rock position, the reading is determined based on the actual state of the rock, with noise added.
   - If the agent is not at the rock position, a random reading is returned (with the same noise probability to maintain consistency).
3. **Other Actions**: For actions other than check actions, the observation remains NULL.

This should better model the true distribution of observations conditioned on the state.
