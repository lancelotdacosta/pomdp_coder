Certainly! Let's break down the problem and then improve the `observation_func` function.

### Explanation of the Observation Distribution

1. **Agent Position**: The agent's position `(x, y)` is always part of the observation.
2. **Rock Check Actions**:
   - If the agent performs a rock check action (`CHECK_ROCK_0` or `CHECK_ROCK_1`), and it is at the corresponding rock's position, the observation will include the rock index and a noisy reading of whether the rock is good or bad.
   - If the agent performs a rock check action but is not at the corresponding rock's position, the observation should still include the rock index and a null reading (i.e., `is_good = None`).
3. **Other Actions**: For all other actions, the observation should be NULL (i.e., `rock_idx = None` and `is_good = None`).

### Improved `observation_func` Function

The main issue in the original code is that it does not handle the case where the agent performs a rock check action but is not at the corresponding rock's position. In this case, the observation should still include the rock index and a null reading.

Here is the improved `observation_func` function:

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Rock Check Actions**:
   - The `rock_idx_to_check` is calculated by subtracting `RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0` from the action.
   - The `obs.rock_idx` is set to `rock_idx_to_check` regardless of whether the agent is at the corresponding rock position.
   - If the agent is at the correct rock position, the observation includes the noisy reading.
   - If the agent is not at the correct rock position, the observation still includes the rock index but sets `is_good` to `None`.

This should better model the true distribution of observations conditioned on the state.
