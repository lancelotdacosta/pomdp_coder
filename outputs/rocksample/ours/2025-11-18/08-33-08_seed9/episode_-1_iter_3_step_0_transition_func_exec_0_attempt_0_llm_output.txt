Based on the provided samples and the discrepancies between the real world and the generated model, it appears that the issue lies in how the `MOVE_NORTH` action is being applied. Specifically, the `y` coordinate is being incorrectly decremented instead of incremented when moving north.

The correct behavior for the `MOVE_NORTH` action should be to move the agent one step up in the grid, which means increasing the `y` coordinate if within bounds, not decreasing it.

Here is the improved `transition_func` function:

```python
def transition_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int) -> RockSampleState:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment 
        action (int): action to be taken in state `state`
    Returns:
        new_state (RockSampleState): the new state of the environment
    """
    x, y, rocks = state.x, state.y, state.rocks

    # Define the action effects
    if action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_NORTH:
        y = min(y + 1, GRID_SIZE - 1)
    elif action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_SOUTH:
        y = max(y - 1, 0)
    elif action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_EAST:
        x = min(x + 1, GRID_SIZE - 1)
    elif action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_WEST:
        x = max(x - 1, 0)
    elif action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            rocks = list(rocks)
            rocks[rock_idx] = not rocks[rock_idx]  # Toggle the rock's state
            rocks = tuple(rocks)
    elif action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        rock_idx = action - RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0
        if (x, y) == ROCK_POSITIONS[rock_idx]:
            # Noisy sensor reading (for simplicity, no noise added here)
            pass

    new_state = RockSampleState(x=x, y=y, rocks=rocks)
    return new_state
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Move North Action**: The `y` coordinate is now incremented using `min(y + 1, GRID_SIZE - 1)` to ensure it does not exceed the grid bounds.
2. **Move South Action**: The `y` coordinate is decremented using `max(y - 1, 0)` to ensure it does not go below 0.

This should correctly model the transition for the `MOVE_NORTH` action and align with the real-world samples provided.
