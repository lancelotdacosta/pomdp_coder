Certainly! Let's analyze the issues and then improve the `reward_func` function to better model the true distribution.

### Analysis

1. **Check Actions at Non-Rock Positions:**
   - In the real world, if the agent performs a check action (`CHECK_ROCK_0` or `CHECK_ROCK_1`) at a position where there is no rock, it should receive a reward of `-1.0` and the episode should continue (`done = False`).
   - In the current implementation, the reward is `0.0` and the episode does not end, which is incorrect.

2. **Exit Action:**
   - The exit action (`EXIT`) should always end the episode (`done = True`), regardless of the state.
   - In the current implementation, the exit action correctly ends the episode but gives a reward of `0.0`, which is correct.

3. **Sample Action at Non-Rock Positions:**
   - If the agent performs a sample action (`SAMPLE`) at a position where there is no rock, it should receive a reward of `-1.0` and the episode should continue (`done = False`).
   - In the current implementation, the reward is `0.0` and the episode does not end, which is incorrect.

4. **Move Actions:**
   - Moving to a new position should give a reward of `0.0` and the episode should continue (`done = False`).
   - This part of the implementation is correct.

### Improved Code

Here is the improved `reward_func` function:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Check if the agent has exited the grid
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        return 0.0, True

    # Check if the agent sampled a rock
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None and next_state.rocks[rock_idx] != state.rocks[rock_idx]:
            return 10.0, False
        else:
            return -1.0, False

    # Check if the agent performed a check action
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            return 0.0, False
        else:
            return -1.0, False

    # Check if the agent moved to a new position
    if (state.x, state.y) != (next_state.x, next_state.y):
        return 0.0, False

    # Default reward for other actions
    return 0.0, False
```

### Explanation

1. **Exit Action:**
   - The exit action always returns a reward of `0.0` and sets `done` to `True`.

2. **Sample Action:**
   - If the agent is at a rock and the rock's state changes (i.e., the rock is sampled), it receives a reward of `10.0`.
   - If the agent is not at a rock or the rock's state does not change, it receives a reward of `-1.0`.

3. **Check Actions:**
   - If the agent is at a rock position, it receives a reward of `0.0`.
   - If the agent is not at a rock position, it receives a reward of `-1.0`.

4. **Move Actions:**
   - If the agent moves to a new position, it receives a reward of `0.0` and the episode continues.

This improved function should better align with the observed distribution from the real world.
