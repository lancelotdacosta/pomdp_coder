### Explanation of the Distribution of Next States Conditioned on Actions and Previous States

1. **Move Actions (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST)**: 
   - The agent's position changes based on the action.
   - The agent cannot move outside the grid boundaries (1 to `GRID_SIZE` for both x and y).
   - The rocks' states remain unchanged.

2. **Sample Action**:
   - If the agent is at a rock's position, the rock is sampled and marked as BAD (`False`).
   - If the agent is not at a rock's position, no change occurs in the state.

3. **Exit Action**:
   - No change in the state.

4. **Check Rock Actions**:
   - If the agent is at the rock's position, a noisy observation is generated.
   - The observation has a 90% chance of being correct.
   - If the agent is not at the rock's position, the observation is `None`.
   - The rocks' states remain unchanged.

The transition function models these rules to generate the next state based on the current state and the action taken.
