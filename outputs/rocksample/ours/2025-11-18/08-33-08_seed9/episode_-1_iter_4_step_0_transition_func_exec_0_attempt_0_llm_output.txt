Certainly! Let's analyze the issue and improve the `transition_func` function to better model the true distribution of next states.

### Current Behavior:
- When the agent performs the `SAMPLE` action at a rock position, the rock's state is toggled (i.e., good becomes bad, and bad becomes good).
- The observed sample from the real world shows that performing the `SAMPLE` action on a rock does not change its state.

### Desired Behavior:
- The `SAMPLE` action should not change the state of the rock. It should simply return the state as it was before the action.

### Explanation:
The current implementation of the `SAMPLE` action toggles the rock's state, which is incorrect. The correct behavior should be to leave the rock's state unchanged when the `SAMPLE` action is performed.

### Improved Code:
Here is the improved `transition_func` function that correctly models the `SAMPLE` action:

```python
def transition_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int) -> RockSampleState:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment 
        action (int): action to be taken in state `state`
    Returns:
        new_state (RockSampleState): the new state of the environment
    """
    x, y, rocks = state.x, state.y, state.rocks

    # Define the action effects
    if action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_NORTH:
        y = min(y + 1, GRID_SIZE - 1)
    elif action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_SOUTH:
        y = max(y - 1, 0)
    elif action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_EAST:
        x = min(x + 1, GRID_SIZE - 1)
    elif action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_WEST:
        x = max(x - 1, 0)
    elif action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            # The rock's state should remain unchanged
            pass
    elif action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        rock_idx = action - RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0
        if (x, y) == ROCK_POSITIONS[rock_idx]:
            # Noisy sensor reading (for simplicity, no noise added here)
            pass

    new_state = RockSampleState(x=x, y=y, rocks=rocks)
    return new_state
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- The `SAMPLE` action now does nothing to the rock's state. It simply checks if the agent is at a rock position and then returns the state as it was before the action.
- This ensures that the rock's state remains unchanged when the `SAMPLE` action is performed.

This should better align with the observed distribution from the real world.
