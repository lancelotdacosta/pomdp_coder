To model the distribution of initial states, we need to consider the provided samples and infer a probabilistic distribution that can generate these initial states. 

From the samples:
- The agent's starting position (x, y) varies across the grid: (1, 2), (0, 4), (2, 1), (0, 0).
- The state of the rocks is also varied: [G, B], [B, B], [B, G].

We can assume:
- The agent's starting position is uniformly distributed across the grid.
- The state of each rock is independently good (G) or bad (B) with equal probability.

Let's implement the `initial_func` function to sample from this distribution:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: RockSampleState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (RockSampleState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (RockSampleState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define the possible starting positions for the agent
    possible_positions = [
        (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 2), (2, 1)
    ]
    
    # Randomly select a starting position for the agent
    x, y = random.choice(possible_positions)
    
    # Define the possible states for each rock (G or B)
    rock_states = [True, False]  # True for G, False for B
    
    # Randomly select the state for each rock
    rocks = tuple(random.choice(rock_states) for _ in range(NUM_ROCKS))
    
    # Create and return the initial state
    return RockSampleState(x=x, y=y, rocks=rocks)
```

This function will generate an initial state by:
1. Randomly selecting a starting position for the agent from the provided samples.
2. Randomly assigning a state (good or bad) to each rock, with each state having an equal probability.
