Certainly! Based on the samples provided, it seems that the reward is conditioned on the agent's position, the action taken, and the state of the rocks. Here are the key observations:

1. **Sampling Rock**: If the agent performs the `SAMPLE` action and is at a rock, the reward depends on whether the rock is good or bad. If the rock is good, the reward is 10.0. If the rock is bad, the reward is -10.0. If the agent samples when not at a rock, the reward is -10.0.

2. **Exiting the Grid**: If the agent performs the `EXIT` action, the episode ends (`done = True`). The reward for exiting is 0.0 unless the agent is at a rock that is good, in which case the reward is 10.0.

3. **No Action Effect**: For other actions (e.g., moving), the reward is 0.0 and `done` remains `False`.

4. **State Transition**: The next state should reflect any changes due to the action. For example, if the agent samples a rock, the rock's status may change from good to bad or vice versa.

With these observations, let's improve the `reward_func` function:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    reward = 0.0
    done = False

    # Check if the agent is at a rock and samples it
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            if state.rocks[rock_idx]:  # Good rock
                reward = 10.0
            else:  # Bad rock
                reward = -10.0
        else:
            reward = -10.0  # Sampling when not at a rock

    # Check if the agent exits the grid
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        done = True
        if state.at_rock() is not None and state.rocks[state.at_rock()]:
            reward = 10.0

    return reward, done
```

This function now correctly handles the conditions observed in the real-world samples:

- It checks if the agent is at a rock and samples it, providing the appropriate reward based on the rock's status.
- It sets `done` to `True` when the agent exits the grid, and provides a reward of 10.0 if the agent is at a good rock while exiting.
- For other actions, it defaults to a reward of 0.0 and keeps `done` as `False`.

This should better model the true distribution of rewards in the environment.
