Based on the observed discrepancies between the generated model and the real-world samples, it appears that the boundary conditions for the grid are not being handled correctly. Specifically, the agent should not move beyond the grid boundaries (1 to `GRID_SIZE` inclusive).

Here's the improved `transition_func` function that better models the true distribution of next states conditioned on actions and previous states:

```python
def transition_func(state, action):
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment 
        action (int): action to be taken in state `state`
    Returns:
        new_state (RockSampleState): the new state of the environment
    """
    new_state = copy.deepcopy(state)

    if action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_NORTH:
        new_state.y = max(1, new_state.y - 1)
    elif action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_SOUTH:
        new_state.y = min(GRID_SIZE, new_state.y + 1)
    elif action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_EAST:
        new_state.x = min(GRID_SIZE, new_state.x + 1)
    elif action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_WEST:
        new_state.x = max(1, new_state.x - 1)
    elif action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = new_state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            new_state.rocks = tuple(new_state.rocks[:rock_idx] + (False,) + new_state.rocks[rock_idx+1:])
    elif action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        pass  # No change in state for the exit action
    elif action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        rock_idx = new_state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None and action == RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0 + rock_idx:
            # Check actions do not change the state
            pass
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown action: {action}")

    return new_state
```

### Explanation

- **Boundary Conditions**: The grid boundaries are set from 1 to `GRID_SIZE` inclusive. The `max(1, ...)` and `min(GRID_SIZE, ...)` functions ensure that the agent's position does not go out of these bounds.
- **Movement Actions**:
  - `MOVE_NORTH`: Decreases the y-coordinate by 1, but ensures it doesn't go below 1.
  - `MOVE_SOUTH`: Increases the y-coordinate by 1, but ensures it doesn't go above `GRID_SIZE`.
  - `MOVE_EAST`: Increases the x-coordinate by 1, but ensures it doesn't go above `GRID_SIZE`.
  - `MOVE_WEST`: Decreases the x-coordinate by 1, but ensures it doesn't go below 1.
- **Sampling and Checking Actions**: These actions are handled as before. Sampling changes the rock's state to `False`, and checking does not change the state.

This function should now correctly model the true distribution of next states based on the provided environment description and the observed real-world samples.
