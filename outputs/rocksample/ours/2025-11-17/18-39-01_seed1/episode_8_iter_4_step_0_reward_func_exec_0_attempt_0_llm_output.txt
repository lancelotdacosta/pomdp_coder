Certainly! Let's first understand the reward conditioned on the state, action, and next state transition in English:

1. **Exit Action**:
   - If the agent performs the `EXIT` action and is at one of the specific exit locations `(0, 0)` or `(GRID_SIZE - 1, GRID_SIZE - 1)`, it receives a reward of `10.0` and the episode ends (`done = True`).
   - If the agent performs the `EXIT` action but is not at one of the specific exit locations, it receives a reward of `0.0` and the episode does not end (`done = False`).

2. **Sample Action**:
   - If the agent performs the `SAMPLE` action and is at a rock location, it receives a reward based on the quality of the rock:
     - `10.0` if the rock is good.
     - `-10.0` if the rock is bad.
   - If the agent performs the `SAMPLE` action but is not at a rock location, it receives a reward of `0.0` and the episode does not end.

3. **Check Rock Actions**:
   - If the agent performs a `CHECK_ROCK` action and is at the corresponding rock location, it receives a reward of `-1.0` and the episode does not end.
   - If the agent performs a `CHECK_ROCK` action but is not at the corresponding rock location, it receives a reward of `0.0` and the episode does not end.

4. **Other Actions**:
   - For all other actions (e.g., moving), the agent receives a reward of `0.0` and the episode does not end.

Now, let's improve the `reward_func` function to better model the true distribution:

```python
def reward_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, next_state: RockSampleState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Check if the agent exits the grid
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        # Only provide a reward if the agent is at a specific exit location
        if (state.x, state.y) in [(0, 0), (GRID_SIZE - 1, GRID_SIZE - 1)]:
            return 10.0, True
        else:
            return 0.0, False

    # Check if the agent samples a rock
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            if state.rocks[rock_idx]:
                return 10.0, False
            else:
                return -10.0, False
        else:
            return 0.0, False

    # Check if the agent checks a rock
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        rock_idx = action - RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0
        if state.at_rock() == rock_idx:
            return -1.0, False
        else:
            return 0.0, False

    # For all other actions, there is no reward
    return 0.0, False
```

This updated `reward_func` function should better align with the observed distribution from the real world. It correctly handles the cases where the agent performs the `CHECK_ROCK` action at a non-rock location and the `EXIT` action at a non-exit location.
