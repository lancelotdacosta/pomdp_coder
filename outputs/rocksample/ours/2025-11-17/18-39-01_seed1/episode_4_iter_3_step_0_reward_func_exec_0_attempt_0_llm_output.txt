Certainly! Let's first break down the reward function based on the provided environment and the observed discrepancies.

### Reward Function Explanation:
1. **EXIT Action**:
   - If the agent performs an `EXIT` action, it should receive:
     - A reward of 10 if all rocks are bad (i.e., no good rocks) in the final state.
     - A reward of 0 otherwise.
   - The episode should be marked as done only when the agent exits with all rocks being bad.

2. **SAMPLE Action**:
   - If the agent performs a `SAMPLE` action:
     - Check if the agent is at a rock. If not, give a reward of -10.
     - If the agent is at a rock and the rock is good, give a reward of 1 and mark the rock as bad.
     - If the agent is at a rock and the rock is already bad, give a reward of -1.

3. **CHECK Actions**:
   - If the agent performs a `CHECK_ROCK` action:
     - Check the state of the rock at the specified index.
     - If the rock is good, give a reward of -1.
     - If the rock is bad, give a reward of 0.

4. **Other Actions**:
   - For all other actions (e.g., move actions), the reward is 0 and the episode is not done.

### Improved Reward Function:
Let's improve the `reward_func` to better match the true distribution based on the above explanation and the observed discrepancies.

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Check if the action is an exit action
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        # Check if all rocks are bad in the final state
        if all(not rock for rock in next_state.rocks):
            return 10.0, True
        else:
            return 0.0, False

    # Check if the action is a sample action
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        # Determine which rock is being sampled
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            # If the rock is good, the agent gets a reward and the rock becomes bad
            if state.rocks[rock_idx]:
                next_rocks = list(next_state.rocks)
                next_rocks[rock_idx] = False
                if tuple(next_rocks) == next_state.rocks:
                    return 1.0, False
                else:
                    return -1.0, False
            else:
                return -1.0, False
        else:
            return -10.0, False

    # Check if the action is a check rock action
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        rock_idx = action - RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0
        if rock_idx < len(state.rocks):
            if state.rocks[rock_idx]:
                return -1.0, False
            else:
                return 0.0, False
        else:
            return 0.0, False

    # For all other actions, the reward is 0 and the episode is not done
    return 0.0, False
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **EXIT Action**:
   - The logic for the `EXIT` action remains the same.
   - Ensured that the episode is marked as done only when all rocks are bad.

2. **SAMPLE Action**:
   - Added a check to ensure that if the rock is good and the agent samples it, the rock should become bad in the next state.
   - If the rock is already bad, the agent receives a reward of -1.
   - If the agent tries to sample at a position without a rock, it receives a reward of -10.

3. **CHECK Actions**:
   - Corrected the logic to ensure that checking a rock gives a reward of -1 if it is good and 0 if it is bad.

4. **Other Actions**:
   - Ensured that all other actions result in a reward of 0 and the episode is not done.

This improved `reward_func` should better match the true distribution and handle the observed discrepancies.
