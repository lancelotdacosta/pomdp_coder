Certainly! Let's analyze the discrepancies between the real-world samples and the current model to understand the reward function better.

### Analysis of Discrepancies

1. **EXIT Action:**
   - The real world gives a reward of 10.0 and sets `done` to `True` if the agent is at any position on the grid boundary when performing the EXIT action. The current model only checks for the exact position `(GRID_SIZE, GRID_SIZE)`.
   - **Solution:** Update the condition to check for any boundary position.

2. **SAMPLE Action:**
   - The real world gives a reward of 10.0 and sets `done` to `True` if the agent is at a rock position and the rock is bad. This suggests that sampling a bad rock should also give a positive reward and end the episode.
   - **Solution:** Modify the condition to include the case where the rock is bad.

3. **CHECK_ROCK Actions:**
   - The real world gives a reward of -1.0 and sets `done` to `False` when performing CHECK_ROCK actions. This suggests that checking a rock has a negative reward.
   - **Solution:** Add conditions for CHECK_ROCK actions to return a reward of -1.0.

### Updated Reward Function

Here is the updated `reward_func` function:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    reward = 0.0
    done = False

    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        # Check if the agent is at any boundary position
        if state.x == 0 or state.x == GRID_SIZE - 1 or state.y == 0 or state.y == GRID_SIZE - 1:
            reward = 10.0
            done = True
        else:
            reward = 0.0
            done = False

    elif action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        # Check if the agent is at a rock position
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            # If the rock is good, reward is 10.0, otherwise 0.0
            reward = 10.0
            done = True
        else:
            reward = 0.0
            done = False

    elif action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        # Checking a rock gives a negative reward
        reward = -1.0
        done = False

    return reward, done
```

This updated function should better align with the observed distribution of the real-world samples.
