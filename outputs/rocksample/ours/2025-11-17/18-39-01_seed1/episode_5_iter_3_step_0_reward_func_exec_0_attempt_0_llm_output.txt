Certainly! Let's analyze the issues and improve the `reward_func` function.

### Analysis

1. **Exit Action (`EXIT`)**:
   - The real-world samples indicate that the episode is only marked as done when the agent exits from the top-left corner `(0, 0)`. However, your current implementation marks the episode as done regardless of the agent's position when the `EXIT` action is performed.
   - **Improvement**: Ensure that the `done` flag is set to `True` only if the agent is at the top-left corner `(0, 0)` when performing the `EXIT` action.

2. **Sampling and Checking Actions**:
   - The reward for sampling and checking actions seems to be correctly implemented based on the provided conditions. However, it's important to verify that the next state remains consistent with the action taken.

3. **Other Actions**:
   - For actions other than `SAMPLE`, `CHECK_ROCK_0`, `CHECK_ROCK_1`, and `EXIT`, the reward should be `0.0` and the episode should not be marked as done.

### Improved `reward_func` Function

Here is the improved `reward_func` function:

```python
def reward_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, next_state: RockSampleState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    reward = 0.0
    done = False

    # Check if the agent is at a rock position
    at_rock = state.at_rock()

    # Determine the reward based on the action
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        if at_rock is not None:
            if state.rocks[at_rock]:  # If the rock is good
                reward = 10.0
            else:  # If the rock is bad
                reward = -10.0
        else:
            reward = -10.0  # Sampling when not at a rock

    elif action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        if at_rock == action - RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0:
            reward = -1.0  # Check rock when at the correct rock position
        else:
            reward = 0.0  # Check rock when not at the correct rock position

    elif action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        if state.x == 0 and state.y == 0:  # Exit from the top-left corner
            reward = 10.0
            done = True
        else:
            reward = 0.0
            done = False  # Episode is not done if not at (0, 0)

    return reward, done
```

### Explanation

1. **Exit Action**:
   - The `done` flag is now set to `True` only if the agent is at `(0, 0)` when performing the `EXIT` action.
   - If the agent is not at `(0, 0)`, the `done` flag remains `False`.

2. **Sampling and Checking Actions**:
   - The rewards for sampling and checking actions are correctly calculated based on the agent's position and the state of the rocks.

3. **Other Actions**:
   - For all other actions, the reward is `0.0` and the episode is not marked as done.

This should better align with the observed real-world samples and the expected behavior of the environment.
