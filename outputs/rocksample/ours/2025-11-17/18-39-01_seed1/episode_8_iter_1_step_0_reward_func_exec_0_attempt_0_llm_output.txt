Based on the provided samples, it appears that the reward function should consider the following conditions:

1. **Exit Action**: If the agent performs the `EXIT` action, it should receive a reward of 10.0 and the episode should be marked as done.
2. **Sample Action**:
   - If the agent is at a rock position and performs the `SAMPLE` action, it should receive a reward based on the quality of the rock:
     - +10.0 if the rock is good (True).
     - -10.0 if the rock is bad (False).
   - If the agent is not at a rock position and performs the `SAMPLE` action, it should receive no reward (0.0).
3. **Check Rock Action**:
   - If the agent performs a `CHECK_ROCK` action and is at the corresponding rock position, it should receive a small negative reward (-1.0).
   - If the agent performs a `CHECK_ROCK` action but is not at the corresponding rock position, it should receive no reward (0.0).

Given these conditions, here is the improved `reward_func` function:

```python
def reward_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, next_state: RockSampleState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Check if the agent exits the grid
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        return 10.0, True

    # Check if the agent samples a rock
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            if state.rocks[rock_idx]:
                return 10.0, False
            else:
                return -10.0, False
        else:
            return 0.0, False

    # Check if the agent checks a rock
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        rock_idx = action - RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0
        if state.at_rock() == rock_idx:
            return -1.0, False
        else:
            return 0.0, False

    # For all other actions, there is no reward
    return 0.0, False
```

This function should now better model the true distribution of rewards based on the provided samples.
