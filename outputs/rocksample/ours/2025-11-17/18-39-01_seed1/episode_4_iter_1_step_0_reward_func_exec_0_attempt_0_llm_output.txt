Certainly! Let me first explain the desired behavior of the reward function based on the given samples:

### Desired Behavior of Reward Function

1. **Exit Action (`EXIT`)**:
   - If all rocks are bad in the final state, the reward is 10.0 and the episode ends.
   - Otherwise, the reward is 0.0 and the episode ends.

2. **Sample Action (`SAMPLE`)**:
   - If the agent is at a rock's position and the rock is good, the reward is 1.0 and the rock becomes bad. The episode does not end.
   - If the agent is at a rock's position and the rock is already bad, the reward is -1.0. The episode does not end.
   - If the agent is not at a rock's position, the reward is -10.0. The episode does not end.

3. **Check Rock Actions (`CHECK_ROCK_0`, `CHECK_ROCK_1`)**:
   - The reward is 0.0, and the episode does not end.

4. **Other Actions (Movement actions: `MOVE_NORTH`, `MOVE_SOUTH`, `MOVE_EAST`, `MOVE_WEST`)**:
   - The reward is 0.0, and the episode does not end.

### Improved Code

Here is the improved `reward_func` function that better models the true distribution:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Check if the action is an exit action
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        # Check if all rocks are bad in the final state
        if all(not rock for rock in next_state.rocks):
            return 10.0, True
        else:
            return 0.0, True

    # Check if the action is a sample action
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        # Determine which rock is being sampled
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            # If the rock is good, the agent gets a reward and the rock becomes bad
            if state.rocks[rock_idx]:
                next_rocks = list(next_state.rocks)
                next_rocks[rock_idx] = False
                if tuple(next_rocks) == next_state.rocks:
                    return 1.0, False
                else:
                    return -10.0, False
            else:
                return -1.0, False
        else:
            return -10.0, False

    # Check if the action is a check rock action
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        return 0.0, False

    # For all other actions (movement actions), the reward is 0 and the episode is not done
    return 0.0, False
```

This improved function ensures that the reward and done conditions match the true distribution as shown in the provided samples.
