Certainly! Let's analyze the reward conditioned on state, action, and next state transition based on the provided samples and improve the `reward_func` function accordingly.

### Analysis:
1. **Action 5 (EXIT):**
   - When the agent exits the environment, it should receive a reward of 10.0 if it is at any of the exit positions (e.g., (4, y) for y in [1, 3, 4]).
   - The episode should be marked as done when the agent exits.

2. **Action 4 (SAMPLE):**
   - If the agent samples a rock and the rock's state changes, it should receive a positive reward.
   - If the rock's state does not change, it should receive a negative reward.

3. **Other Actions:**
   - For other actions (e.g., MOVE_NORTH, MOVE_SOUTH, MOVE_EAST, MOVE_WEST), the reward is generally 0 if the agent moves correctly.
   - If the agent remains in the same position when it should have moved, it should receive a negative reward.

### Improved `reward_func`:
```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    reward = 0.0
    done = False

    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        # Exit action: reward of 10.0 if at an exit position (4, y)
        if next_state.x == 4 and next_state.y in [1, 3, 4]:
            reward = 10.0
            done = True
        else:
            reward = -1.0

    elif action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None and state.rocks[rock_idx] != next_state.rocks[rock_idx]:
            reward = 10.0
        else:
            reward = -10.0

    elif action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        if state.x == next_state.x and state.y == next_state.y:
            reward = -1.0
        else:
            reward = 0.0

    elif action in [RockSampleActions.MOVE_NORTH, RockSampleActions.MOVE_SOUTH, RockSampleActions.MOVE_EAST, RockSampleActions.MOVE_WEST]:
        if state.x != next_state.x or state.y != next_state.y:
            reward = 0.0
        else:
            reward = -1.0

    return reward, done
```

### Explanation:
- **EXIT Action:**
  - The agent receives a reward of 10.0 and the episode is marked as done if it exits from one of the exit positions.
  - If the agent tries to exit from a non-exit position, it receives a negative reward.

- **SAMPLE Action:**
  - The agent receives a positive reward (10.0) if it samples a rock and the rock's state changes.
  - If the rock's state does not change, it receives a significant negative reward (-10.0) to discourage futile sampling.

- **CHECK Actions:**
  - The agent receives a negative reward (-1.0) if it remains in the same position after a check action.
  - It receives 0.0 if it moves as expected.

- **Movement Actions:**
  - The agent receives 0.0 if it successfully moves to a new position.
  - It receives a negative reward (-1.0) if it fails to move.

This improved `reward_func` should better align with the observed distribution and handle the specific cases you mentioned.
