### Explanation of the Observation Distribution:

The observation distribution conditioned on a state is as follows:

1. **Agent Position**: The observation always includes the agent's current position `(x, y)`.

2. **Rock Check Actions**: 
   - If the action is a `CHECK_ROCK` action, the observation will include the index of the rock being checked (`rock_idx`) and a noisy reading of whether the rock is good or bad (`is_good`).
   - The noisy reading is accurate 90% of the time. There is a 10% chance that the reading will be flipped (i.e., good becomes bad and vice versa).

3. **Other Actions**:
   - For all other actions (including movement, sampling, and exiting), the observation will have `rock_idx` and `is_good` set to `None`.

This distribution ensures that the agent receives useful information when checking rocks but also accounts for the possibility of sensor noise.
