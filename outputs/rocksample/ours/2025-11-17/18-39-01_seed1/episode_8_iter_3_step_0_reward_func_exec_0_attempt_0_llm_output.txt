Certainly! Let's analyze the problem and then improve the `reward_func` function to better model the true distribution of rewards.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Exit Action**:
   - The exit action should only provide a reward if the agent is at one of the specific exit locations: `(0, 0)` or `(GRID_SIZE - 1, GRID_SIZE - 1)`. In your current implementation, the exit action always provides a reward of 10.0 if the action is 5, regardless of the agent's position.

2. **Check Rock Action**:
   - The check rock action should provide a penalty of -1.0 if the agent is at the rock's position. In your current implementation, the check rock action does not provide any penalty if the agent is not at the rock's position.

3. **Sample Rock Action**:
   - The sample rock action should provide a reward of 10.0 if the rock is good and -10.0 if the rock is bad. This part seems to be correctly implemented.

### Improved `reward_func` Function

```python
def reward_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, next_state: RockSampleState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Check if the agent exits the grid
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        # Only provide a reward if the agent is at a specific exit location
        if (state.x, state.y) in [(0, 0), (GRID_SIZE - 1, GRID_SIZE - 1)]:
            return 10.0, True
        else:
            return 0.0, False

    # Check if the agent samples a rock
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            if state.rocks[rock_idx]:
                return 10.0, False
            else:
                return -10.0, False
        else:
            return 0.0, False

    # Check if the agent checks a rock
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        rock_idx = action - RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0
        if state.at_rock() == rock_idx:
            return -1.0, False
        else:
            return 0.0, False

    # For all other actions, there is no reward
    return 0.0, False
```

### Explanation

1. **Exit Action**:
   - The condition `(state.x, state.y) in [(0, 0), (GRID_SIZE - 1, GRID_SIZE - 1)]` ensures that the reward is only provided if the agent is at one of the specific exit locations.

2. **Check Rock Action**:
   - The condition `if state.at_rock() == rock_idx` ensures that the penalty of -1.0 is provided only if the agent is at the rock's position and attempts to check it.

3. **Sample Rock Action**:
   - This part remains unchanged as it already correctly provides the appropriate rewards based on the rock's status.

By making these improvements, the `reward_func` function should now better model the true distribution of rewards as observed in the real world.
