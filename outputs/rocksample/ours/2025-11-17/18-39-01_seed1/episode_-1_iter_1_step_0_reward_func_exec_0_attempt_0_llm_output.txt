Based on the provided examples and the observed discrepancies between the real world and the generated model, it appears that the reward function is not correctly handling the `EXIT` action and the `SAMPLE` action. Specifically:

1. **Exit Action (Action 5)**: The `EXIT` action should provide a large positive reward (`10.0`) and terminate the episode (`done = True`) if the agent is at one of the exit positions (in this case, positions (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), and (1, 4)).
2. **Sample Action (Action 4)**: The `SAMPLE` action should provide a negative reward (`-10.0`) if the agent is not at a rock position.

Let's update the `reward_func` to reflect these observations:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    reward = 0.0
    done = False

    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None and state.rocks[rock_idx] != next_state.rocks[rock_idx]:
            reward = 10.0
        else:
            reward = -10.0

    elif action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        if state.x == next_state.x and state.y == next_state.y:
            reward = -1.0
        else:
            reward = 0.0

    elif action in [RockSampleActions.MOVE_NORTH, RockSampleActions.MOVE_SOUTH, RockSampleActions.MOVE_EAST, RockSampleActions.MOVE_WEST]:
        if state.x != next_state.x or state.y != next_state.y:
            reward = 0.0
        else:
            reward = -1.0

    elif action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        exit_positions = [(4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (1, 4)]
        if (state.x, state.y) in exit_positions:
            reward = 10.0
            done = True

    return reward, done
```

### Explanation:
- **Exit Action**: The `EXIT` action now checks if the agent is at one of the predefined exit positions. If so, it provides a reward of `10.0` and sets `done` to `True`.
- **Sample Action**: The `SAMPLE` action now provides a negative reward of `-10.0` if the agent is not at a rock position.
- **Other Actions**: The rewards for other actions remain as they were, ensuring no movement or check actions provide appropriate penalties based on the state transition.

This updated function should better align with the observed distribution in the real world.
