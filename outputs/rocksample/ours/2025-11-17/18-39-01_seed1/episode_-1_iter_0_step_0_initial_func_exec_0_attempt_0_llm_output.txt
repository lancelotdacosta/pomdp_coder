Based on the provided samples, it appears that the distribution of initial states is as follows:

- The agent's starting position can be any valid cell in the grid (excluding walls).
- The rock quality (good or bad) for each rock is independently determined with equal probability.

Given this understanding, here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

# Domain parameters (feel free to tweak)
NUM_ROCKS = 2
GRID_SIZE = 5
ROCK_POSITIONS = [(1, 1), (1, 4)]   # len == NUM_ROCKS

# State definition
@dataclass
class RockSampleState(State):
    x: int
    y: int
    rocks: Tuple[bool, ...]   # immutable tuple of good/bad flags

def initial_func(empty_state: RockSampleState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (RockSampleState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (RockSampleState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Randomly select a starting position for the agent
    x = random.randint(0, GRID_SIZE - 1)
    y = random.randint(0, GRID_SIZE - 1)
    
    # Ensure the selected position is not a wall
    while (x, y) in ROCK_POSITIONS:
        x = random.randint(0, GRID_SIZE - 1)
        y = random.randint(0, GRID_SIZE - 1)
    
    # Randomly determine the quality of each rock (True = GOOD, False = BAD)
    rocks = tuple(random.choice([True, False]) for _ in range(NUM_ROCKS))
    
    # Create and return the initial state
    return RockSampleState(x=x, y=y, rocks=rocks)
```

This function initializes the agent's position randomly within the grid, ensuring it does not start on a rock. It also randomly assigns the quality of each rock as either good or bad. This implementation should generate initial states that are consistent with the provided samples.
