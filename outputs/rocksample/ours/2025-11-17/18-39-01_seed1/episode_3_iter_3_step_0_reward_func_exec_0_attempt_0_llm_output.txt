Certainly! Let's analyze the discrepancies between the real-world samples and the model's predictions.

### Reward Function Analysis

1. **Checking Rock Actions (CHECK_ROCK_0, CHECK_ROCK_1):**
   - In the real world, performing a `CHECK_ROCK` action results in a reward of `-1.0` and the episode is not done.
   - The current model does not handle these actions and returns a reward of `0.0` and `False` for the `done` flag.

2. **Exit Action (EXIT):**
   - In the real world, performing an `EXIT` action at the exit position `(4, 4)` or `(4, 1)` results in a reward of `10.0` and the episode is done.
   - The current model only checks if the agent is at the exit position at the grid's boundary `(GRID_SIZE, GRID_SIZE)` and returns a reward of `0.0` and `False` for the `done` flag if the agent is not at that position.

### Improved Reward Function

To better model the true distribution, we need to:
1. Handle the `CHECK_ROCK` actions correctly.
2. Ensure the `EXIT` action checks the correct exit positions.

Here is the improved `reward_func`:

```python
def reward_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, next_state: RockSampleState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    reward = 0.0
    done = False

    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        # Check rock actions always result in a reward of -1.0 and the episode is not done
        reward = -1.0
        done = False

    elif action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        # Check if the agent is at any of the exit positions
        exit_positions = [(4, 1), (4, 4)]
        if (state.x, state.y) in exit_positions:
            reward = 10.0
            done = True
        else:
            reward = 0.0
            done = False

    elif action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        # Check if the agent is at a rock position
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            # If the rock is good, reward is 10.0, otherwise 0.0
            reward = 10.0 if state.rocks[rock_idx] else 0.0
            done = True
        else:
            reward = 0.0
            done = False

    return reward, done
```

### Explanation

1. **Checking Rock Actions:**
   - For actions `CHECK_ROCK_0` and `CHECK_ROCK_1`, the function now returns a reward of `-1.0` and sets `done` to `False`.

2. **Exit Action:**
   - The function now checks if the agent is at any of the exit positions `(4, 1)` or `(4, 4)`. If the agent is at one of these positions and performs the `EXIT` action, the reward is `10.0` and the episode is marked as done.

This should better align with the real-world samples provided.
