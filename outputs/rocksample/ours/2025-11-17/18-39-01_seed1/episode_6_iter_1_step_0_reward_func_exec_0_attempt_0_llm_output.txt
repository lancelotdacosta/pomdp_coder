Certainly! Let's first clarify the reward conditions based on the provided samples and the environment description:

1. **Exiting the Grid**:
   - If the agent performs the `EXIT` action, it should receive a reward of `10.0` and the episode should terminate (`done = True`).

2. **Sampling a Rock**:
   - If the agent performs the `SAMPLE` action at a rock's position and the rock is good (`True`), it should receive a reward of `10.0`.
   - If the agent performs the `SAMPLE` action at a rock's position and the rock is bad (`False`), it should receive a reward of `-10.0`.
   - If the agent performs the `SAMPLE` action but is not at a rock's position, it should receive a reward of `-1.0`.

3. **Checking a Rock**:
   - If the agent performs a `CHECK_ROCK_i` action at the corresponding rock's position, it should receive a reward of `0.0`.
   - If the agent performs a `CHECK_ROCK_i` action but is not at the corresponding rock's position, it should receive a reward of `-1.0`.

4. **Movement Actions**:
   - For all other actions (movement actions), the reward should be `0.0` and the episode should not terminate (`done = False`).

Now, let's improve the `reward_func` function to better model these conditions:

```python
def reward_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, next_state: RockSampleState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Check if the agent has exited the grid
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        return 10.0, True

    # Check if the agent is sampling a rock
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None and next_state.rocks[rock_idx]:
            return 10.0, False
        elif rock_idx is not None and not next_state.rocks[rock_idx]:
            return -10.0, False
        else:
            return -1.0, False

    # Check if the agent is checking a rock
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        rock_idx = action - RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0
        if state.at_rock() == rock_idx:
            return 0.0, False
        else:
            return -1.0, False

    # For all other actions (movement), the reward is 0 and the episode is not done
    return 0.0, False
```

This function now correctly handles the conditions for exiting, sampling, checking rocks, and performing movement actions based on the provided samples and the environment description.
