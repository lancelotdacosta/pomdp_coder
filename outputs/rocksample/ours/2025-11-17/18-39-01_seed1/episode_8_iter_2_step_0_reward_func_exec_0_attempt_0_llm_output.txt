Based on the provided samples and the discrepancies between the real world and the model, it appears that the `reward_func` function is not correctly handling the conditions under which the EXIT action should provide a reward. Specifically, the EXIT action should only provide a reward if the agent is at a specific exit location. Additionally, the CHECK actions should provide a small negative reward only when the agent is at the rock being checked.

Here is the improved `reward_func` function:

```python
def reward_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, next_state: RockSampleState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Check if the agent exits the grid
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        # Only provide a reward if the agent is at a specific exit location
        if (state.x, state.y) == (0, 0) or (state.x, state.y) == (GRID_SIZE - 1, GRID_SIZE - 1):
            return 10.0, True
        else:
            return 0.0, False

    # Check if the agent samples a rock
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            if state.rocks[rock_idx]:
                return 10.0, False
            else:
                return -10.0, False
        else:
            return 0.0, False

    # Check if the agent checks a rock
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        rock_idx = action - RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0
        if state.at_rock() == rock_idx:
            return -1.0, False
        else:
            return 0.0, False

    # For all other actions, there is no reward
    return 0.0, False
```

### Explanation of the Changes:
1. **EXIT Action**:
   - The EXIT action should only provide a reward if the agent is at one of the specified exit locations, which are typically the corners of the grid (e.g., (0, 0) or (GRID_SIZE - 1, GRID_SIZE - 1)).
   - If the agent is not at an exit location, the reward should be 0 and the episode should not terminate.

2. **CHECK Actions**:
   - The CHECK actions should provide a small negative reward (-1.0) only when the agent is at the rock being checked.
   - If the agent is not at the rock being checked, the reward should be 0.

These changes ensure that the reward function more accurately reflects the true distribution of rewards in the environment based on the provided samples.
