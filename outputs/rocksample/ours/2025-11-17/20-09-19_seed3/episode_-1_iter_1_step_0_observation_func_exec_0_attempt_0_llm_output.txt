Certainly! Let's analyze the problem and improve the `observation_func` function to better match the true distribution of observations.

### Analysis of the Problem

1. **Observation Function Behavior**:
   - The `observation_func` should return an observation based on the state and the action taken.
   - For actions like `CHECK_ROCK_0` and `CHECK_ROCK_1`, the function should check if the agent is at the rock's position and then simulate a noisy reading with a 90% chance of being correct.
   - If the agent is not at the rock's position, it should still return an observation with `rock_idx` set to the corresponding rock index but `is_good` set to `None`.

2. **Current Issues**:
   - The current implementation correctly handles the case where the agent is at the rock's position.
   - However, it does not handle the case where the agent is not at the rock's position but still returns an observation with `rock_idx` set to the corresponding rock index.

### Improved `observation_func`

```

### Explanation

1. **Handling CHECK Actions**:
   - If the agent is at the rock's position, it simulates a noisy reading with a 90% chance of being correct.
   - If the agent is not at the rock's position, it still sets `rock_idx` to the corresponding rock index but sets `is_good` to `None`.

2. **Other Actions**:
   - For all other actions, it returns an empty observation with `rock_idx` and `is_good` set to `None`.

This should better match the true distribution of observations in the environment.
