Based on the provided samples, it seems that the movement actions (MOVE_NORTH, MOVE_SOUTH, MOVE_EAST, MOVE_WEST) are not correctly handling the grid boundaries and the agent's position. The real world samples show that the agent should move within the grid boundaries (1 to GRID_SIZE) and not go out of bounds. 

The current implementation uses `min` and `max` functions with incorrect boundary values, leading to the observed discrepancies. For example, the agent should not move below y=1 when moving north, or above y=GRID_SIZE when moving south.

Here is the improved `transition_func` function:

```python
def transition_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int) -> RockSampleState:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment 
        action (int): action to be taken in state `state`
    Returns:
        new_state (RockSampleState): the new state of the environment
    """
    new_state = copy.deepcopy(state)
    
    if action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_NORTH:
        new_state.y = max(1, new_state.y - 1)
    elif action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_SOUTH:
        new_state.y = min(GRID_SIZE, new_state.y + 1)
    elif action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_EAST:
        new_state.x = min(GRID_SIZE, new_state.x + 1)
    elif action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_WEST:
        new_state.x = max(1, new_state.x - 1)
    elif action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = new_state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            # Sampling the rock changes its state with some probability
            if random.random() < 0.5:  # 50% chance to change state
                new_state.rocks = new_state.rocks[:rock_idx] + (not new_state.rocks[rock_idx],) + new_state.rocks[rock_idx+1:]
    elif action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        pass  # The agent stays in the same position
    elif action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        pass  # Checking a rock does not change the state

    return new_state
```

This improved function correctly handles the grid boundaries for movement actions. The `max` and `min` functions are adjusted to ensure the agent's position remains within the valid range of 1 to `GRID_SIZE` for both x and y coordinates. This should align with the real-world samples provided.
