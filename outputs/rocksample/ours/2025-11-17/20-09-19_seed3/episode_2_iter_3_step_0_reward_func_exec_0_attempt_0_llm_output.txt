Certainly! Let's improve the `reward_func` function based on the observed discrepancies between the real world samples and the generated model.

### Explanation

1. **Exit Action**:
   - The exit action should only provide a reward if the agent is not at a rock position. If the agent is at a rock position and tries to exit, it should still be penalized.

2. **Sample Action**:
   - The sample action should only provide a positive or negative reward if the agent is at a rock position. If the agent is not at a rock position and tries to sample, it should be penalized.

3. **Check Actions**:
   - The check actions (CHECK_ROCK_0, CHECK_ROCK_1) should only provide a penalty if the agent is not at the corresponding rock position. If the agent is at the correct rock position, there should be no penalty.

4. **Other Actions**:
   - For other actions (MOVE_NORTH, MOVE_SOUTH, MOVE_EAST, MOVE_WEST), there should be no reward unless specified otherwise.

### Improved `reward_func` Function

Here is the improved `reward_func` function:

```python
def reward_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, next_state: RockSampleState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    reward = 0.0
    done = False

    # Check if the agent has taken the exit action
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        if state.at_rock() is None:
            done = True
        else:
            reward = -10.0  # Penalty for trying to exit while at a rock position
        return reward, done

    # Check if the agent has sampled a rock
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            if state.rocks[rock_idx]:
                reward = 10.0  # Reward for sampling a good rock
            else:
                reward = -10.0  # Penalty for sampling a bad rock
        else:
            reward = -10.0  # Penalty for trying to sample when not at a rock

    # Check if the agent has performed a check action
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        rock_idx = action - RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0
        if (state.x, state.y) != ROCK_POSITIONS[rock_idx]:
            reward = -1.0  # Penalty for checking a rock from an incorrect position

    # No other actions provide rewards in the given samples
    return reward, done
```

This improved function should better match the real world samples provided. The key changes are:

- Adding a penalty for trying to exit while at a rock position.
- Ensuring that the sample action only provides a reward or penalty when the agent is at a rock position.
- Ensuring that the check actions only provide a penalty if the agent is not at the corresponding rock position.
