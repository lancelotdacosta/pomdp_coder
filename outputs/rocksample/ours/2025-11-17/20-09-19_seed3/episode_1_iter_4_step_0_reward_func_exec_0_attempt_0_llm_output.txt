Certainly! Let's analyze the reward function based on the provided examples and improve it accordingly.

### Explanation of the Reward Function

1. **Sampling Action (4 - SAMPLE)**:
   - If the agent is at a rock and samples it:
     - If the rock is good (`True`), the agent gets a reward of 10.0.
     - If the rock is bad (`False`), the agent gets a penalty of -10.0.
   - The episode ends (`done = True`) if the agent samples any rock.

2. **Check Actions (6 - CHECK_ROCK_0, 7 - CHECK_ROCK_1)**:
   - If the agent is at a rock and checks it:
     - If the rock is good (`True`), the agent gets a reward of 0.0.
     - If the rock is bad (`False`), the agent gets a penalty of -1.0.
   - The episode does not end (`done = False`).

3. **Exit Action (5 - EXIT)**:
   - If the agent performs the exit action, the episode ends (`done = True`) with a reward of 0.0.

4. **Other Actions**:
   - For all other actions, the reward is 0.0 and the episode does not end (`done = False`).

### Improved Code

```python
def reward_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, next_state: RockSampleState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Determine if the agent is at a rock position
    rock_index = state.at_rock()
    
    # Check if the action is to sample a rock
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE and rock_index is not None:
        # If the rock was good, the agent gets a reward of 10.0
        if state.rocks[rock_index]:
            return 10.0, True
        # If the rock was bad, the agent receives a penalty of -10.0
        else:
            return -10.0, True
    
    # Check if the action is to check a rock
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS and rock_index is not None:
        # If the rock is bad, the agent receives a penalty of -1.0
        if not state.rocks[rock_index]:
            return -1.0, False
        # If the rock is good, no penalty
        else:
            return 0.0, False

    # Check if the action is to exit
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        return 0.0, True

    # For all other actions, the reward is 0.0
    return 0.0, False
```

This improved function should better align with the observed behavior in the real world based on the provided examples.
