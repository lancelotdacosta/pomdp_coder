### Explanation of the Reward Function:

1. **Sampling a Rock (`SAMPLE` Action)**:
   - If the agent samples a rock and the rock was initially good (True), but becomes bad (False) in the next state, the agent receives a reward of 10.0.
   - If the agent samples a rock that is already bad (False), or if there is no rock at the current position, the agent receives a penalty of -1.0.

2. **Exiting the Environment (`EXIT` Action)**:
   - If the agent exits the environment, the episode ends, and the reward is 0.0.

3. **Other Actions**:
   - For all other actions (such as moving or checking a rock), the reward is 0.0, and the episode continues.

This reward function captures the essence of the provided examples and generalizes to similar scenarios in the RockSample domain.
