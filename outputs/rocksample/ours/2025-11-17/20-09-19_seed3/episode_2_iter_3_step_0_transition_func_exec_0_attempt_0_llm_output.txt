Based on the observed discrepancies between the real-world samples and the generated model, it appears that the agent's movement is sometimes constrained or modified by the environment. Specifically, the agent might not always move as expected due to some form of environmental noise or constraints.

### Explanation of the Distribution:
- **Movement Actions (MOVE_NORTH, MOVE_SOUTH, MOVE_EAST, MOVE_WEST)**: The agent's movement is often successful, but there are instances where the agent does not move as intended. This could be due to some kind of random noise or environmental constraints.
- **Sampling and Exit Actions**: These actions seem to work as expected, with no discrepancies observed.
- **Check Actions**: These actions do not change the state, which is consistent with both the real-world samples and the model.

To better model this distribution, we can introduce a small probability that the agent's movement is blocked or redirected. For simplicity, we'll assume a 10% chance that the movement action fails and the agent remains in the same position.

This updated `transition_func` function introduces a 10% chance that the agent's movement fails and the agent remains in the same position. This should better reflect the observed distribution of next states conditioned on actions and previous states.
