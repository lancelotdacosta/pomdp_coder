### Explanation of the Distribution of Next States

The transition function models the distribution of next states based on the current state and the action taken. Here's how it works for each action:

1. **Move Actions (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST)**: These actions change the agent's position on the grid. The new position is determined by moving the agent in the specified direction, ensuring that the agent does not move outside the grid boundaries.

2. **Sample Action**: This action samples a rock if the agent is at a rock's position. If the agent is at a rock, the rock is marked as "good" (True). If the agent is not at a rock, the state remains unchanged.

3. **Exit Action**: This action does nothing to the state, as the environment does not change when the agent exits.

4. **Check Rock Actions (CHECK_ROCK_0, CHECK_ROCK_1)**: These actions check the rock at the agent's current position. If the agent is at the specified rock's position, the state remains unchanged. If the agent is not at the rock, the state also remains unchanged.

The function ensures that the agent's movements and actions are consistent with the grid boundaries and the positions of the rocks. The rock states are updated based on the sample action, and the agent's position is updated based on the move actions. The check actions only return the current state if the agent is at the specified rock.
