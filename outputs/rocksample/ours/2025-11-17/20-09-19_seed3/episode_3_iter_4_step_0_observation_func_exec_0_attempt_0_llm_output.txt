Based on the provided samples and the discrepancies between the real-world observations and the generated model, it appears that the current implementation is overly strict about the agent's position when performing a check rock action. In the real world, the agent can observe a rock even if it is not exactly at the rock's position, but within a certain range or field of view.

To better model this distribution, we need to relax the condition that the agent must be exactly at the rock's position to get an observation. Instead, we can allow the agent to observe the rock if it is within a certain distance (e.g., a 1-step radius).

Here's the improved `observation_func` function:

```python
def observation_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, empty_obs: RockSampleObservation) -> RockSampleObservation:
    """
    Represents the non-centered field of view of the agent.

    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the previous action that was taken
        empty_obs (RockSampleObservation): an empty observation that needs to be filled and returned
    Returns:
        obs (RockSampleObservation): observation of the agent
    """
    # Initialize the observation with the current position
    obs = copy.deepcopy(empty_obs)
    obs.x = state.x
    obs.y = state.y

    # Determine if the action is a check rock action
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        rock_idx = action - RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0
        rock_pos = ROCK_POSITIONS[rock_idx]
        
        # Check if the agent is within a 1-step radius of the rock's position
        if abs(state.x - rock_pos[0]) <= 1 and abs(state.y - rock_pos[1]) <= 1:
            # Generate a noisy reading of the rock's quality
            is_good = state.rocks[rock_idx]
            if random.random() < 0.1:  # 10% chance of a false reading
                is_good = not is_good
            obs.rock_idx = rock_idx
            obs.is_good = is_good
        else:
            # If the agent is not within the rock's field of view, set rock_idx and is_good to None
            obs.rock_idx = None
            obs.is_good = None

    return obs
```

### Explanation:
- **Field of View**: The agent can observe a rock if it is within a 1-step radius (i.e., 1 step in any direction) from the rock's position. This is implemented using the condition `abs(state.x - rock_pos[0]) <= 1 and abs(state.y - rock_pos[1]) <= 1`.
- **Noisy Reading**: If the agent is within the rock's field of view, it will generate a noisy reading of the rock's quality. There is a 10% chance that the reading will be incorrect.
- **No Observation**: If the agent is not within the rock's field of view, the `rock_idx` and `is_good` fields are set to `None`.

This approach should better match the real-world distribution of observations, allowing the agent to observe rocks even when it is not exactly at their positions.
