Certainly! Based on the provided samples, it seems that there are discrepancies in how the movement actions are being handled. Specifically, the `MOVE_NORTH` action is not always reducing the y-coordinate by 1, and similarly for other movements.

The distribution of next states conditioned on actions and previous states can be described as follows:

1. **MOVE_NORTH**: The agent should move north (decrease y by 1) unless it is already at the top of the grid (y == 0). If it is at the top, it should remain in the same position.
2. **MOVE_SOUTH**: The agent should move south (increase y by 1) unless it is already at the bottom of the grid (y == GRID_SIZE - 1). If it is at the bottom, it should remain in the same position.
3. **MOVE_EAST**: The agent should move east (increase x by 1) unless it is already at the rightmost edge of the grid (x == GRID_SIZE - 1). If it is at the rightmost edge, it should remain in the same position.
4. **MOVE_WEST**: The agent should move west (decrease x by 1) unless it is already at the leftmost edge of the grid (x == 0). If it is at the leftmost edge, it should remain in the same position.
5. **SAMPLE**: If the agent is at a rock position, it should sample the rock, changing its state to `False` (bad).
6. **EXIT**: No change in state.
7. **CHECK_ROCK_0 and CHECK_ROCK_1**: If the agent is at the corresponding rock position, it should simulate a noisy sensor reading with 90% accuracy.

Given this understanding, let's improve the `transition_func` function:

This updated `transition_func` function ensures that the agent's movements are handled correctly within the grid boundaries. The movement actions now check the grid limits before updating the state, which should align with the observed behavior from the real world.
