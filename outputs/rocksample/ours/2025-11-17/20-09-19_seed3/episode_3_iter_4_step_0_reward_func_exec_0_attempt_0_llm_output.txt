Certainly! Let's break down the issues and then improve the `reward_func` function to better model the true distribution.

### Explanation of the Reward Function

1. **Exit Action (`EXIT`)**:
   - If the agent performs the `EXIT` action, the episode should end (`done = True`).
   - The reward should be 10.0 if all rocks have been sampled and marked as bad (i.e., no rock is good).
   - If any rock is still good, the reward should be 0.0.

2. **Sample Action (`SAMPLE`)**:
   - If the agent samples a rock at its current position, the reward should be 10.0 if the rock is good and -10.0 if the rock is bad.
   - If there is no rock at the current position, the reward should be -1.0.

3. **Check Action (`CHECK_ROCK_0`, `CHECK_ROCK_1`)**:
   - If the agent checks the correct rock at its current position, the reward should be 0.0.
   - If the agent checks the wrong rock or there is no rock at the current position, the reward should be -1.0.

4. **Other Actions (Movement)**:
   - For all other actions (move), the reward should be 0.0 and the episode should not end (`done = False`).

### Improved Code

Here is the improved `reward_func` function:

```python
def reward_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, next_state: RockSampleState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Define the reward based on the action and the resulting state
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        # If the agent exits, the episode is done
        # Check if any rock has been sampled and marked as bad
        if all(not r for r in state.rocks):
            return 10.0, True
        else:
            return 0.0, True

    elif action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            # If the agent samples a rock, check if it was good
            if state.rocks[rock_idx] == True:
                return 10.0, False
            else:
                return -10.0, False
        else:
            # No rock at this position
            return -1.0, False
    
    elif action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is None or action != RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0 + rock_idx:
            # No rock at this position or checking wrong rock
            return -1.0, False
        else:
            # Checking the correct rock
            return 0.0, False

    else:
        # For all other actions (move), the reward is usually 0
        return 0.0, False
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Exit Action**:
   - The reward and `done` status were already correct in the original code.

2. **Sample Action**:
   - The reward and `done` status were already correct in the original code.

3. **Check Action**:
   - The reward was corrected to return -1.0 if the agent checks the wrong rock or there is no rock at the current position.

4. **Other Actions**:
   - The reward and `done` status were already correct in the original code.

This improved function should now better match the true distribution of rewards in the environment.
