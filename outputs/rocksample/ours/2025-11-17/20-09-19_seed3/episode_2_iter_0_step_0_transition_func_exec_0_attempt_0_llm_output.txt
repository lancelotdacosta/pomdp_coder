### Explanation of the Distribution of Next States Conditioned on Actions and Previous States

1. **Movement Actions (MOVE_NORTH, MOVE_SOUTH, MOVE_EAST, MOVE_WEST)**:
   - The agent moves one step in the specified direction, but it cannot move outside the grid boundaries. If the move would take it out of bounds, the position remains unchanged.
   
2. **Sample Action (SAMPLE)**:
   - The agent can sample a rock if it is at the same position as the rock. Sampling a rock sets its state to `False` (bad rock), regardless of its previous state. If the agent is not at a rock's position, the state remains unchanged.
   
3. **Exit Action (EXIT)**:
   - The agent does nothing and the state remains unchanged.
   
4. **Check Rock Actions (CHECK_ROCK_0, CHECK_ROCK_1)**:
   - The agent checks the rock at the specified position. If the agent is at the rock's position, it simulates a noisy sensor reading with 90% accuracy. This means there is a 10% chance that the rock's state will be flipped (good to bad or bad to good).
   - If the agent is not at the rock's position, the state remains unchanged.

This transition function models the environment's dynamics based on the provided samples and generalizes to other possible states and actions.
