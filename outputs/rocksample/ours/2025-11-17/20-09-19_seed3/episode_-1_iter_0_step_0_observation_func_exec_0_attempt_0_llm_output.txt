    Represents the non-centered field of view of the agent.

    The observation represents the agent's relative view of the world. 

    The agent is NOT in the center of the observation grid.

    Observation grids are always square-sizes (i.e. 3x3, 5x5, 7x7).

    The width and height of the observation grid are called view size.

    The agent is ALWAYS at obs.image[view_size // 2, view_size - 1] in the observation `image`

### Explanation of the Observation Distribution

The observation distribution conditioned on a state in the RockSample environment can be described as follows:

1. **Non-Check Actions**: For actions that are not rock-checking actions (e.g., moving, sampling, exiting), the observation will always be an empty observation containing only the agent's current position `(x, y)` and `None` for the rock index and reading.

2. **Check Actions**:
   - If the agent performs a check action (e.g., `CHECK_ROCK_0` or `CHECK_ROCK_1`), and the agent is at the position of the rock being checked:
     - The observation will include the rock index and a noisy reading.
     - The reading is correct with a 90% probability and incorrect with a 10% probability.
   - If the agent performs a check action but is not at the position of the rock being checked:
     - The observation will be an empty observation containing only the agent's current position `(x, y)` and `None` for the rock index and reading.

This distribution ensures that the agent receives meaningful observations when it is in the correct position to check a rock, while providing no additional information for other actions or positions.
