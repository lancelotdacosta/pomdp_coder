Certainly! Let's analyze the problem and then improve the `reward_func` function to better model the true distribution.

### Analysis

1. **Exit Action (ACTION 5)**:
   - The provided samples show that the agent receives a reward of 10.0 and the episode ends (`done = True`) when the exit action is taken at positions (4, 3) and (4, 1).
   - This suggests that the exit condition is met even if the agent is not at the bottom-right corner (4, 4), but rather at any position along the rightmost column (x = 4).

2. **Other Actions**:
   - The existing logic for sampling actions, checking rock actions, and other movement actions seems to be correct.

### Improved `reward_func` Function

We need to modify the exit condition to reflect the new understanding that the agent can exit from any position along the rightmost column (x = 4).

```python
def reward_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, next_state: RockSampleState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Check if the agent is at a rock and attempts to sample it
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None and state.rocks[rock_idx] == True:
            return 10.0, False  # Sampling a good rock gives a reward of 10.0
        else:
            return -10.0, False  # Sampling a bad rock or no rock gives a penalty of -10.0

    # Check if the agent has reached the exit
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        if next_state.x == GRID_SIZE - 1:  # Agent can exit from any position along the rightmost column
            return 10.0, True  # Exiting the grid ends the episode with a reward of 10.0
        else:
            return 0.0, False  # Attempting to exit but not at the exit column gives no penalty

    # Penalty for checking rock actions
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        return -1.0, False  # Checking a rock gives a small penalty

    # For all other actions (move), there is no immediate reward
    return 0.0, False
```

### Explanation

1. **Exit Action**:
   - The condition `if next_state.x == GRID_SIZE - 1` checks if the agent is in the rightmost column. If this condition is met, the agent receives a reward of 10.0 and the episode ends (`done = True`).

2. **Other Actions**:
   - The logic for sampling rocks, checking rocks, and other movement actions remains unchanged.

This should align the model's behavior more closely with the observed distribution from the real world.
