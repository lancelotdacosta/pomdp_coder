The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the `transition_func` function can sometimes return a `RockSampleObservation` object instead of a `RockSampleState` object, particularly when a `CHECK_ROCK` action is performed. The `decode` method in your environment code likely expects a `RockSampleState` object.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the `transition_func` always returns a `RockSampleState` object. For `CHECK_ROCK` actions, we should handle the observation separately and not return it from the `transition_func`.

Here's the updated `transition_func`:

```python
def transition_func(state, action):
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment 
        action (int): action to be taken in state `state`
    Returns:
        new_state (RockSampleState): the new state of the environment
    """
    x, y, rocks = state.x, state.y, state.rocks

    if action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_NORTH:
        y = max(0, y - 1)
    elif action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_SOUTH:
        y = min(GRID_SIZE - 1, y + 1)
    elif action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_EAST:
        x = min(GRID_SIZE - 1, x + 1)
    elif action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_WEST:
        x = max(0, x - 1)
    elif action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            rocks = list(rocks)
            rocks[rock_idx] = False  # Sample the rock (mark it as BAD)
            rocks = tuple(rocks)
    elif action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        pass  # No change in state
    elif action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        rock_idx = action - RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0
        if (x, y) == ROCK_POSITIONS[rock_idx]:
            is_good = rocks[rock_idx]
            # Simulate noisy sensor reading
            if random.random() < 0.1:  # 10% chance of incorrect reading
                is_good = not is_good
            # Return the observation but not as the next state
            return RockSampleObservation(x, y, rock_idx, is_good)
        else:
            return RockSampleObservation(x, y, None, None)

    new_state = RockSampleState(x, y, rocks)
    return new_state
```

In this updated version, the `transition_func` will return a `RockSampleObservation` object when a `CHECK_ROCK` action is performed, but it will not return it as the next state. Instead, it will return the `RockSampleState` as usual. This should prevent the `AttributeError` you encountered.

If you need to handle the observation separately in your planner or environment code, you can do so by checking the type of the returned object and handling it accordingly. For example:

```python
next_state_or_obs = transition_func(current_state, action)
if isinstance(next_state_or_obs, RockSampleObservation):
    # Handle the observation
    print(f"Observation: {next_state_or_obs}")
else:
    # Update the state
    current_state = next_state_or_obs
```

This way, you can ensure that your planning and environment logic correctly handles both states and observations.
