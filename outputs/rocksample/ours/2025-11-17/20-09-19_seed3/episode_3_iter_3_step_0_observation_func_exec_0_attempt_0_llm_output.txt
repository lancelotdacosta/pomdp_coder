Certainly! Let's analyze the issue and improve the `observation_func` function.

### Analysis

The problem lies in how the function handles the `CHECK_ROCK_0` and `CHECK_ROCK_1` actions when the agent is not at the rock's position. According to the real-world samples, even if the agent is not at the rock's position, it still returns an observation with `rock_idx` and `is_good` set to `None`. However, this contradicts the behavior of the real world, where the agent should return an observation indicating that the rock was not found (i.e., `rock_idx` and `is_good` should be `None`).

### Improvements

1. **Correct Handling of Rock Position**: Ensure that the function correctly handles cases where the agent is not at the rock's position.
2. **Noise in Reading**: Maintain the 10% chance of a false reading when the agent is at the rock's position.

Here is the improved `observation_func`:

### Explanation

- **Correct Handling of Rock Position**: The function now correctly sets `rock_idx` and `is_good` to `None` when the agent is not at the rock's position.
- **Noise in Reading**: The 10% chance of a false reading is maintained when the agent is at the rock's position.

This should align the generated observations with the real-world samples provided.
