Based on the provided samples from the real world and your current implementation, it seems there are specific conditions under which the reward and termination signals differ. Here's a breakdown of the observed discrepancies and the necessary adjustments to the `reward_func` function:

1. **Checking Rock Actions**: The real world provides a penalty of -1.0 for checking rock actions, whereas the current model gives 0.0. This suggests that checking rock actions should result in a small penalty.

2. **Exiting the Grid**: The real world rewards 10.0 and terminates the episode when the agent attempts to exit from the correct position (4, 3) with bad rocks, while the current model gives a penalty of -10.0. This indicates that the exit action should be conditioned on the grid position and not just the action type.

3. **Exiting from Incorrect Position**: The real world gives 0.0 reward and does not terminate the episode when the agent attempts to exit from an incorrect position, while the current model penalizes this action with -10.0. This suggests that the penalty for an incorrect exit attempt should be adjusted.

4. **Consistency in Rock Checking**: The real world consistently provides a penalty of -1.0 for rock checking actions, regardless of the rock's state.

Given these observations, here is the improved `reward_func`:

```python
def reward_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, next_state: RockSampleState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Check if the agent is at a rock and attempts to sample it
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None and state.rocks[rock_idx] == True:
            return 10.0, False  # Sampling a good rock gives a reward of 10.0
        else:
            return -10.0, False  # Sampling a bad rock or no rock gives a penalty of -10.0

    # Check if the agent has reached the exit
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        if (next_state.x, next_state.y) == (GRID_SIZE - 1, GRID_SIZE - 1):
            return 10.0, True  # Exiting the grid ends the episode with a reward of 10.0
        else:
            return 0.0, False  # Attempting to exit but not at the exit location gives no penalty

    # Penalty for checking rock actions
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        return -1.0, False  # Checking a rock gives a small penalty

    # For all other actions (move), there is no immediate reward
    return 0.0, False
```

This improved function should better align with the observed distribution from the real world by addressing the specific conditions mentioned.
