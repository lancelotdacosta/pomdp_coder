The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the `decode` method in your environment code is trying to handle a `RockSampleObservation` object as if it were a `RockSampleState` object. To fix this, we need to ensure that the `transition_func` always returns a `RockSampleState` object, and handle the observation separately.

Here's a revised version of the `transition_func` that ensures it always returns a `RockSampleState` object:

```python
def transition_func(state, action):
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment 
        action (int): action to be taken in state `state`
    Returns:
        new_state (RockSampleState): the new state of the environment
    """
    x, y, rocks = state.x, state.y, state.rocks

    if action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_NORTH:
        y = max(0, y - 1)
    elif action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_SOUTH:
        y = min(GRID_SIZE - 1, y + 1)
    elif action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_EAST:
        x = min(GRID_SIZE - 1, x + 1)
    elif action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_WEST:
        x = max(0, x - 1)
    elif action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            rocks = list(rocks)
            rocks[rock_idx] = False  # Sample the rock (mark it as BAD)
            rocks = tuple(rocks)
    elif action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        pass  # No change in state
    elif action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        rock_idx = action - RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0
        if (x, y) == ROCK_POSITIONS[rock_idx]:
            is_good = rocks[rock_idx]
            # Simulate noisy sensor reading
            if random.random() < 0.1:  # 10% chance of incorrect reading
                is_good = not is_good
            return RockSampleState(x, y, rocks), RockSampleObservation(x, y, rock_idx, is_good)
        else:
            return RockSampleState(x, y, rocks), RockSampleObservation(x, y, None, None)

    new_state = RockSampleState(x, y, rocks)
    return new_state, RockSampleObservation(x, y, None, None)
```

In this version:
- The `transition_func` always returns a tuple `(new_state, observation)`.
- For actions that do not generate an observation, a default `RockSampleObservation` object with `rock_idx` and `is_good` set to `None` is returned.

Now, in your planner or environment code, you can handle the returned values appropriately:

```python
# Example usage of transition_func
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Define the initial state
    current_state = RockSampleState(x=3, y=3, rocks=(True, False))

    # Define the action
    action = RockSampleActions.MOVE_EAST

    # Call the transition function
    new_state, observation = transition_func(current_state, action)

    print(f"New State: {new_state}")
    print(f"Observation: {observation}")
```

In this example:
- `new_state` is the new state of the environment.
- `observation` is the observation generated by the action (or a default observation if no specific action was performed).

This should prevent the `AttributeError` and ensure that your code handles both states and observations correctly.
