Certainly! Let's analyze the discrepancies between the real-world samples and the model's output.

### Analysis of Discrepancies

1. **Exit Action at Non-Exit Locations:**
   - The exit action should only provide a reward when the agent is at the exit location (usually (0, 0) or the top-left corner of the grid). In your current implementation, the exit action always provides a reward of 10.0 and marks the episode as done, regardless of the agent's position.

2. **Check Rock Actions at Incorrect Positions:**
   - The check rock actions should provide a reward of -1.0 if the agent is not at the correct rock position. Your current implementation does not account for this case.

### Improved Reward Function

Here is the improved `reward_func` function that addresses the issues identified:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    reward = 0.0
    done = False

    # Movement actions do not give rewards
    if action in [RockSampleActions.MOVE_NORTH, RockSampleActions.MOVE_SOUTH, RockSampleActions.MOVE_EAST, RockSampleActions.MOVE_WEST]:
        reward = 0.0

    # Sampling action
    elif action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            if next_state.rocks[rock_idx] != state.rocks[rock_idx]:
                # The rock was sampled and the type changed
                reward = 10.0
            else:
                # The rock was not changed (bad sample)
                reward = -1.0
        else:
            # Sampled at a location with no rock
            reward = -1.0

    # Exit action
    elif action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        if (state.x, state.y) == (0, 0):
            reward = 10.0
            done = True
        else:
            reward = -1.0

    # Check actions
    elif action in [RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0, RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_1]:
        rock_idx = action - RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0
        if state.at_rock() == rock_idx:
            # At the correct rock position
            reward = 0.0
        else:
            # Not at the correct rock position
            reward = -1.0

    return reward, done
```

### Explanation

1. **Exit Action:**
   - The exit action now checks if the agent is at the exit location (0, 0). If the agent is at this location, it provides a reward of 10.0 and marks the episode as done. Otherwise, it provides a reward of -1.0 to penalize the incorrect exit attempt.

2. **Check Rock Actions:**
   - The check rock actions now correctly provide a reward of -1.0 if the agent is not at the correct rock position. This ensures that the agent learns to move to the correct rock position before performing the check action.

This improved function should better match the true distribution of rewards in the environment.
