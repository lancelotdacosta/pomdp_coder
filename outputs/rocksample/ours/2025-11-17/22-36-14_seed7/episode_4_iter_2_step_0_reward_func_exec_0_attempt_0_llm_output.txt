Certainly! Let's analyze the discrepancy between the real-world samples and the model's output to identify the issues and improve the `reward_func` function.

### Analysis:
1. **Exit Action (5):**
   - The real-world samples indicate that the exit action should only give a reward if the agent is at the correct position to exit. This condition was not checked in the original code.
   
2. **Check Rock Actions (6, 7):**
   - The real-world samples show that the check rock actions should give a reward of -1.0 if the agent is not at the rock's position, which is consistent with the original code. However, the original code does not correctly handle the case where the agent is at the rock's position but still gives a reward of -1.0 instead of 0.0.

### Improved `reward_func`:
- Add a check to ensure the agent is at the correct position to exit.
- Ensure that the check rock actions give a reward of 0.0 when the agent is at the rock's position and -1.0 otherwise.

Here is the improved `reward_func`:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    
    # Check if the agent has exited the grid
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        exit_position = (0, 0)  # Example exit position, adjust as needed
        if (state.x, state.y) == exit_position:
            return 10.0, True
        else:
            return -10.0, False
    
    # Check if the agent has sampled a rock
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None and state.rocks[rock_idx]:
            return 10.0, False
        else:
            return -10.0, False
    
    # Check for movement actions
    if action in [RockSampleActions.MOVE_NORTH, RockSampleActions.MOVE_SOUTH, 
                  RockSampleActions.MOVE_EAST, RockSampleActions.MOVE_WEST]:
        return 0.0, False
    
    # Check for check rock actions
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        rock_idx = action - RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0
        if (state.x, state.y) == ROCK_POSITIONS[rock_idx]:
            return 0.0, False
        else:
            return -1.0, False
    
    # Default case
    return 0.0, False
```

### Explanation:
- **Exit Action:**
  - The agent receives a reward of 10.0 and the episode ends if it is at the exit position (0, 0). If not, it receives a penalty of -10.0.
  
- **Sample Action:**
  - The agent receives a reward of 10.0 if it is at a rock's position and the rock is good. Otherwise, it receives a penalty of -10.0.
  
- **Movement Actions:**
  - Movement actions always result in a reward of 0.0 and do not end the episode.
  
- **Check Rock Actions:**
  - The agent receives a reward of 0.0 if it is at the correct rock's position. Otherwise, it receives a penalty of -1.0.

This should bring the model's behavior closer to the true distribution observed in the real world.
