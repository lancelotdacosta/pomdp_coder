The reward function should consider the following conditions:

1. If the agent exits the grid (`EXIT` action), it receives a reward of 10.0 and the episode is terminated.
2. If the agent samples a rock (`SAMPLE` action) and is at a rock location, it receives a reward based on the quality of the rock:
   - 10.0 if the rock is good (True).
   - -10.0 if the rock is bad (False).
3. If the agent performs a `CHECK_ROCK` action, it receives:
   - 0.0 if it is at the correct rock location.
   - -1.0 if it is not at the correct rock location.
4. For all other actions (movement actions), the reward is 0.0 and the episode continues.

Based on the provided samples, there seems to be an issue with the `CHECK_ROCK` actions. The code should ensure that the agent receives -1.0 if the agent is not at the correct rock location, even if the action is a `CHECK_ROCK` action.

Here is the improved `reward_func` function:

```python
def reward_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, next_state: RockSampleState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    
    # Check if the agent has exited the grid
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        return 10.0, True
    
    # Check if the agent has sampled a rock
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            return (10.0, False) if state.rocks[rock_idx] else (-10.0, False)
        else:
            return 0.0, False
    
    # Check for movement actions
    if action in [RockSampleActions.MOVE_NORTH, RockSampleActions.MOVE_SOUTH, 
                  RockSampleActions.MOVE_EAST, RockSampleActions.MOVE_WEST]:
        return 0.0, False
    
    # Check for check rock actions
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        rock_idx = action - RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0
        if (state.x, state.y) == ROCK_POSITIONS[rock_idx]:
            return 0.0, False
        else:
            return -1.0, False
    
    # Default case
    return 0.0, False
```

This function should now correctly handle the `CHECK_ROCK` actions and match the observed distribution from the real world.
