Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `transition_func` function based on the provided environment samples and the given template.

### Explanation of the Distribution

The next state distribution conditioned on actions and previous states can be described as follows:

1. **Move Actions**:
   - **MOVE_NORTH (0)**: The agent moves one step north if it's not at the top boundary.
   - **MOVE_SOUTH (1)**: The agent moves one step south if it's not at the bottom boundary.
   - **MOVE_EAST (2)**: The agent moves one step east if it's not at the right boundary.
   - **MOVE_WEST (3)**: The agent moves one step west if it's not at the left boundary.
   - If the agent is already at a boundary, the action has no effect.

2. **Sample Action (4)**:
   - If the agent is at a rock's position and takes the SAMPLE action, the rock's state changes to `B` (bad).

3. **Exit Action (5)**:
   - The EXIT action does not change the state of the environment.

4. **Check Actions (6 and 7)**:
   - These actions are used to check the state of specific rocks but do not change the state of the environment.

### Implementation of `transition_func`

```python
def transition_func(state, action):
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment 
        action (int): action to be taken in state `state`
    Returns:
        new_state (RockSampleState): the new state of the environment
    """
    new_state = copy.deepcopy(state)  # Create a deep copy of the current state

    if action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_NORTH:
        if new_state.y < GRID_SIZE - 1:
            new_state.y += 1
    elif action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_SOUTH:
        if new_state.y > 0:
            new_state.y -= 1
    elif action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_EAST:
        if new_state.x < GRID_SIZE - 1:
            new_state.x += 1
    elif action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_WEST:
        if new_state.x > 0:
            new_state.x -= 1
    elif action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = new_state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            rocks_list = list(new_state.rocks)
            rocks_list[rock_idx] = False  # Change the rock to bad (B)
            new_state.rocks = tuple(rocks_list)
    elif action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        pass  # No change in state
    elif action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        pass  # No change in state

    return new_state
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Move Actions**: The agent's position is updated based on the action, but it does not move beyond the grid boundaries.
- **Sample Action**: If the agent is at a rock's position and takes the SAMPLE action, the rock's state is changed to `B` (bad).
- **Exit Action**: The EXIT action does not change the state.
- **Check Actions**: These actions do not change the state of the environment.

This implementation ensures that the transition function correctly models the behavior of the environment based on the provided samples and the described distribution.
