The issue in the current `reward_func` is that it does not handle the check actions (`CHECK_ROCK_0` and `CHECK_ROCK_1`) correctly. In the real world, these actions should provide a negative reward when the agent is not at the rock's position, but the current implementation always returns a reward of 0 for these actions.

To improve the model, we need to ensure that the check actions return a negative reward when the agent is not at the rock's position, similar to how the sampling action behaves.

Here is the improved `reward_func`:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    reward = 0.0
    done = False

    # Movement actions do not give rewards
    if action in [RockSampleActions.MOVE_NORTH, RockSampleActions.MOVE_SOUTH, RockSampleActions.MOVE_EAST, RockSampleActions.MOVE_WEST]:
        reward = 0.0

    # Sampling action
    elif action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            if next_state.rocks[rock_idx] != state.rocks[rock_idx]:
                # The rock was sampled and the type changed
                reward = 10.0
            else:
                # The rock was not changed (bad sample)
                reward = -1.0
        else:
            # Sampled at a location with no rock
            reward = -1.0

    # Exit action
    elif action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        reward = 10.0
        done = True

    # Check actions
    elif action in [RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0, RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_1]:
        rock_idx = action - RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0
        if state.at_rock() == rock_idx:
            # At the correct rock position
            reward = 0.0
        else:
            # Not at the correct rock position
            reward = -1.0

    return reward, done
```

This improved function ensures that the check actions (`CHECK_ROCK_0` and `CHECK_ROCK_1`) provide a negative reward when the agent is not at the rock's position, aligning with the observed behavior from the real world.
