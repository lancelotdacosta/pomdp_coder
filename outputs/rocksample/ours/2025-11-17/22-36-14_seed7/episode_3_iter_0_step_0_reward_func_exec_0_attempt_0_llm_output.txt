### Explanation of the Reward Function:

1. **Exiting the Environment**:
   - If the agent chooses to exit the environment (`action == RockSampleActions.EXIT`), the episode ends, and the reward is 0.0.

2. **Sampling a Rock**:
   - If the agent samples a rock (`action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE`), the function checks if the agent is at a rock position using `state.at_rock()`.
   - If the agent is at a rock position, it then checks the state of the rock in the next state.
     - If the rock is good (`next_state.rocks[rock_idx]` is `True`), the agent receives a positive reward of 10.0.
     - If the rock is bad, the agent receives a negative reward of -10.0.
   - If the agent is not at a rock position and tries to sample, it receives a penalty of -1.0.

3. **Checking a Rock**:
   - Actions that check a rock (`action in CHECK_ACTIONS`) do not provide an immediate reward. The reward is 0.0, and the episode continues.

4. **Movement Actions**:
   - Movement actions (`RockSampleActions.MOVE_NORTH`, `RockSampleActions.MOVE_SOUTH`, `RockSampleActions.MOVE_EAST`, `RockSampleActions.MOVE_WEST`) generally do not provide a reward unless they move the agent to a specific rock where sampling occurs.
   - The reward for movement actions is 0.0, and the episode continues.

5. **Other Actions**:
   - Any other action not defined above results in a reward of 0.0, and the episode continues.

This reward function is designed to encourage the agent to explore the environment, move to rock positions, and sample rocks while penalizing unnecessary sampling attempts and providing a positive reward for successfully sampling good rocks.
