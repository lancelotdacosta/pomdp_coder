Certainly! Based on the provided samples and the discrepancies between your model and the real-world observations, it seems there are a few key issues to address:

1. **Checking Rocks**: The real world gives a negative reward for checking rocks, which is currently not handled in your model.
2. **Exiting the Grid**: The real world does not always mark the episode as done when the agent exits the grid, which is currently hardcoded in your model.
3. **State Transitions**: Ensure that the state transitions are correctly modeled, particularly for actions like checking rocks and exiting the grid.

Here's the improved `reward_func` function that addresses these issues:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    
    # Check if the agent has exited the grid
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        # The real world does not always mark the episode as done when exiting
        return 0.0, False
    
    # Check if the agent sampled a rock
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None and state.rocks[rock_idx]:
            return 10.0, False
        else:
            return 0.0, False
    
    # Check if the agent moved
    if action in [RockSampleActions.MOVE_NORTH, RockSampleActions.MOVE_SOUTH, RockSampleActions.MOVE_EAST, RockSampleActions.MOVE_WEST]:
        # No reward for moving
        return 0.0, False
    
    # Check if the agent checked a rock
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        # The real world gives a negative reward for checking rocks
        return -1.0, False
    
    # Default case (should not happen if actions are properly defined)
    return 0.0, False
```

This function now correctly handles the following cases:
- **Exiting the Grid**: The episode is not marked as done when the agent exits the grid.
- **Checking Rocks**: A negative reward of -1.0 is given for checking rocks.
- **Sampling Rocks**: A positive reward of 10.0 is given if the agent samples a good rock.
- **Moving**: No reward is given for moving actions.
- **Default Case**: No reward is given for any other actions.

This should bring your model closer to the true distribution observed in the real world.
