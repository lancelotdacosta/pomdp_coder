Based on the provided samples, it appears that the initial state distribution for the `RockSample` environment is as follows:

- The agent's initial position `(x, y)` is uniformly distributed across all valid grid positions (i.e., positions that are not walls).
- The rocks' qualities (good or bad) are also uniformly distributed, with each rock having an equal probability of being good or bad.

Given this understanding, we can implement the `initial_func` function to sample an initial state from this distribution.

Here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: RockSampleState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (RockSampleState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (RockSampleState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    
    # Function to generate a random valid position for the agent
    def generate_random_position():
        while True:
            x = random.randint(0, GRID_SIZE - 1)
            y = random.randint(0, GRID_SIZE - 1)
            if (x, y) not in ROCK_POSITIONS:  # Ensure the position is not a rock position
                return (x, y)

    # Generate a random initial position for the agent
    x, y = generate_random_position()
    
    # Generate random rock states (good or bad)
    rocks = tuple(random.choice([True, False]) for _ in range(NUM_ROCKS))
    
    # Create and return the initial state
    return RockSampleState(x=x, y=y, rocks=rocks)
```

This function ensures that the agent's initial position is uniformly distributed across all valid grid positions and that the rocks' qualities are also uniformly distributed. The `generate_random_position` helper function ensures that the agent does not start on a rock position.
