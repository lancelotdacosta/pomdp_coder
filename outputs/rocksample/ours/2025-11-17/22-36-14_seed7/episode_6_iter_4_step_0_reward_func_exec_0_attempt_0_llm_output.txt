Based on the provided samples, it appears that the `EXIT` action is not just a neutral action but one that can provide a reward under certain conditions. Specifically, the `EXIT` action seems to yield a reward of 10.0 if the agent is directly on top of a rock, regardless of whether the rock is good or bad. The episode also terminates in these cases.

To better model this behavior, we need to update the `reward_func` function to check if the agent is on top of a rock when the `EXIT` action is taken and then provide the appropriate reward.

Here is the updated `reward_func` function:

```python
def reward_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, next_state: RockSampleState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    
    # Check if the agent has exited the grid
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            return 10.0, True
        else:
            return 0.0, False
    
    # Check if the agent sampled a rock
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            if state.rocks[rock_idx]:
                return 10.0, False
            else:
                return -10.0, False
        else:
            return 0.0, False
    
    # Check if the agent checked a rock
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        return -1.0, False
    
    # Check if the agent moved
    if action in [RockSampleActions.MOVE_NORTH, RockSampleActions.MOVE_SOUTH, RockSampleActions.MOVE_EAST, RockSampleActions.MOVE_WEST]:
        return 0.0, False
    
    # Default case (should not happen if actions are properly defined)
    return 0.0, False
```

This updated function now checks if the `EXIT` action is taken and if the agent is on top of a rock. If so, it returns a reward of 10.0 and terminates the episode. Otherwise, it behaves as before.
