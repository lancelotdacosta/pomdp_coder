Based on the provided samples, it appears that the initial state distribution is as follows:

- The agent's starting position `(x, y)` is uniformly distributed across the grid, with some positions possibly more frequent than others.
- The rocks are always at fixed positions `(1, 1)` and `(1, 4)`.
- The rocks can be either `G` (Good) or `B` (Bad), with each rock independently having a 50% chance of being `G` or `B`.

Given this understanding, we can implement the `initial_func` function to generate an initial state according to this distribution.

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import random
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

# Define the RockSampleState class as given in the template
@dataclass
class RockSampleState(State):
    x: int
    y: int
    rocks: Tuple[bool, ...]   # immutable tuple of good/bad flags

def initial_func(empty_state: RockSampleState) -> RockSampleState:
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (RockSampleState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (RockSampleState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Generate a random position for the agent within the grid
    x = random.randint(0, GRID_SIZE - 1)
    y = random.randint(0, GRID_SIZE - 1)

    # Generate the state of the rocks
    rocks = tuple(random.choice([True, False]) for _ in range(NUM_ROCKS))

    # Create and return the initial state
    return RockSampleState(x=x, y=y, rocks=rocks)
```

This function `initial_func` will generate a random initial state where the agent's position is uniformly distributed across the grid, and each rock has a 50% chance of being good or bad.
