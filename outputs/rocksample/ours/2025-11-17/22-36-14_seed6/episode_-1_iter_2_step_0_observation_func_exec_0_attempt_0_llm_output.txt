Certainly! Let's break down the problem and then improve the `observation_func` function.

### Explanation of the Observation Distribution

1. **Position Observations**:
   - The agent always observes its current position `(x, y)`.

2. **Rock Check Actions**:
   - When the agent performs a rock check action (e.g., `CHECK_ROCK_0`, `CHECK_ROCK_1`), it should observe the rock at the current position if it is present there.
   - If the agent is not at the rock's position, the observation should be `None` for both `rock_idx` and `is_good`.
   - If the agent is at the rock's position, it should observe the rock with a noisy reading:
     - 90% chance of correct reading.
     - 10% chance of incorrect reading.

### Issues in the Current Code

1. **Incorrect Rock Index Check**:
   - The code checks if the agent is at the rock's position using `state.at_rock()`, but this method only returns the index of the rock if the agent is exactly at that rock's position.
   - The action `CHECK_ROCK_X` should always provide an observation for the corresponding rock, regardless of the agent's position.

2. **Noisy Reading**:
   - The noisy reading logic is correct, but it should be applied regardless of whether the agent is at the rock's position or not.

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Rock Index Check**:
   - The rock index is determined directly from the action, ensuring that the agent always provides an observation for the rock being checked, regardless of its position.

2. **Noisy Reading**:
   - The noisy reading logic remains the same, ensuring that the observation is correct 90% of the time and incorrect 10% of the time.

This should better model the true distribution of observations conditioned on the state.
