### Explanation of the Distribution of Next States Conditioned on Actions and Previous States

1. **Move North (Action 0)**: The agent's y-coordinate decreases by 1, but it cannot go below 0.
2. **Move South (Action 1)**: The agent's y-coordinate increases by 1, but it cannot exceed the grid size minus 1.
3. **Move East (Action 2)**: The agent's x-coordinate increases by 1, but it cannot exceed the grid size minus 1.
4. **Move West (Action 3)**: The agent's x-coordinate decreases by 1, but it cannot go below 0.
5. **Sample (Action 4)**: If the agent is at a rock's position, the rock is marked as "sampled" (set to `False`).
6. **Exit (Action 5)**: No change in state.
7. **Check Rock (Actions 6 and 7)**: No change in state, but these actions are used for observing the rocks.

The transition function ensures that the agent's movement is constrained within the grid and that sampling a rock updates the state correctly. The check actions do not change the state but are used for observations, which are not part of the state transition logic.
