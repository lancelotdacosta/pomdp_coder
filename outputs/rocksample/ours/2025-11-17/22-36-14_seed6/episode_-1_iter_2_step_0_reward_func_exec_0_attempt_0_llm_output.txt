Certainly! Let's first explain the reward conditioned on state, action, and next state transition in English:

1. **Sampling a Rock**:
   - If the agent is at a rock and samples it, the reward is +10 if the rock is good, and -10 if the rock is bad.
   - If the agent samples when not at a rock, the reward is -1.0.

2. **Exiting the Grid**:
   - If the agent exits the grid (action `EXIT`), the reward is +10 if the agent is at any position in the last column (x = 4).
   - The episode ends when the agent exits the grid.

3. **Checking a Rock**:
   - If the agent checks a rock while at the correct rock position, the reward is 0.0.
   - If the agent checks a rock while not at the correct rock position, the reward is -1.0.

4. **Moving Actions**:
   - Moving actions (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST) give a reward of 0.0.

Now, let's improve the `reward_func` function to better model the true distribution:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Determine if the agent is at a rock
    current_rock_idx = state.at_rock()
    next_rock_idx = next_state.at_rock()

    # Determine the reward based on the action and the transition
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        if current_rock_idx is not None:
            # If the agent samples a rock, check if the rock was good
            if state.rocks[current_rock_idx]:
                return 10.0, False
            else:
                return -10.0, False
        else:
            # Sampling when not at a rock gives a penalty
            return -1.0, False
    elif action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        # Exiting the grid gives a reward of 10.0 if the agent is in the last column (x = 4)
        if next_state.x == 4:
            return 10.0, True
        else:
            return 0.0, False
    elif action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        # Checking a rock gives no reward if the agent is at the rock position
        if current_rock_idx is not None and action == RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0 + current_rock_idx:
            return 0.0, False
        else:
            return -1.0, False
    else:
        # Moving actions give no reward
        return 0.0, False
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Exiting the Grid**:
   - The condition for the `EXIT` action was incorrect in the original code. It should check the next state's x-coordinate to determine if the agent has successfully exited the grid.
   - The episode ends (`done = True`) only if the agent exits the grid.

2. **Checking a Rock**:
   - The condition for checking a rock was fixed to ensure that the agent is at the correct rock position and the action matches the rock index.
   - If the agent is not at the correct rock position or the action does not match the rock index, a penalty of -1.0 is given.

These changes should better align with the observed distribution from the real world.
