### Explanation:
- **Sampling Action (4)**:
  - If the agent is at a rock and samples it, the reward is determined by the quality of the rock.
  - If the rock is good (`state.rocks[current_rock_idx] == True`), the agent gets a reward of `10.0`.
  - If the rock is bad (`state.rocks[current_rock_idx] == False`), the agent gets a reward of `0.0`.
  - If the agent attempts to sample when not at a rock, it receives a penalty of `-1.0`.

- **Exit Action (5)**:
  - Exiting the grid gives no reward but ends the episode.

- **Check Rock Actions (6, 7)**:
  - Checking a rock gives no reward.

- **Movement Actions (0, 1, 2, 3)**:
  - Moving actions give no reward.

The function also returns a boolean `done` indicating whether the episode is done, which is `True` only when the agent exits the grid.
