Certainly! Let's analyze the reward function based on the provided samples and improve it to better match the true distribution.

### Explanation of the Reward Function

1. **Exiting the Grid**:
   - The agent should receive a positive reward of 10.0 and the episode should end if the agent exits the grid from the correct positions: (0, 0) or (GRID_SIZE - 1, GRID_SIZE - 1).
   - In any other position, the agent should receive 0.0 reward and the episode should not end.

2. **Sampling a Rock**:
   - If the agent attempts to sample a rock at a rock's position, the reward should be:
     - +10.0 if the rock is bad.
     - -10.0 if the rock is good.
   - If the agent attempts to sample a rock at a non-rock position, the reward should be -10.0.

3. **Checking a Rock**:
   - The agent should receive a small negative reward of -1.0 for checking a rock.

4. **Other Actions**:
   - For any other actions (like moving), the agent should receive 0.0 reward.

### Improved Reward Function

Here is the improved `reward_func` function:

```python
def reward_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, next_state: RockSampleState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    
    # Check if the agent has exited the grid from the correct position
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        if (state.x, state.y) in [(0, 0), (GRID_SIZE - 1, GRID_SIZE - 1)]:
            return 10.0, True
        else:
            return 0.0, False

    # Check if the agent has sampled a rock
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            if state.rocks[rock_idx]:
                return -10.0, False  # Sampling a good rock gives negative reward
            else:
                return 10.0, False   # Sampling a bad rock gives positive reward
        else:
            return -10.0, False      # Sampling an empty cell gives negative reward

    # Check if the agent performed a CHECK_ROCK action
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        return -1.0, False  # Small negative reward for checking rocks

    # For other actions (move), no reward is given
    return 0.0, False
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Exiting the Grid**:
   - The condition `(state.x, state.y) in [(0, 0), (GRID_SIZE - 1, GRID_SIZE - 1)]` ensures that the agent only receives a reward and ends the episode when exiting from the correct positions.

2. **Sampling a Rock**:
   - The function correctly differentiates between sampling at a rock's position and an empty cell.
   - It returns the appropriate reward based on whether the rock is good or bad.

3. **Checking a Rock**:
   - The function returns a small negative reward for checking a rock, as specified.

4. **Other Actions**:
   - For any other actions, the function returns 0.0 reward and indicates that the episode is not done.

This improved reward function should now better match the true distribution of the environment based on the provided samples.
