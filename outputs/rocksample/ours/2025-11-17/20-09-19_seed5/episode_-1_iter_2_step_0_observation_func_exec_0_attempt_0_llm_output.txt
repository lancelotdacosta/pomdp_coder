Certainly! Let's analyze the current implementation and identify the issues before improving the `observation_func`.

### Analysis

1. **Current Implementation**:
   - The function correctly handles the position of the agent (`x` and `y`).
   - For `CHECK_ROCK` actions, it checks if the agent is at the rock position and adds noise to the observation with a 10% probability.

2. **Issues Identified**:
   - The current implementation returns `None` for `is_good` if the agent is not at the rock position when performing a check action. This is incorrect because the observation should still reflect the rock index and a noisy reading even if the agent is not at the rock.
   - The noise model might need to be adjusted based on the real-world samples provided.

### Improved Distribution

The distribution of observations conditioned on a state should be as follows:
- If the agent performs a `CHECK_ROCK` action, it should always return an observation with the rock index and a noisy reading, regardless of whether the agent is at the rock position or not.
- The noisy reading should have a 10% chance of being incorrect.

### Improved Code

```python
def observation_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, empty_obs: RockSampleObservation) -> RockSampleObservation:
    """
    Represents the non-centered field of view of the agent.

    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the previous action that was taken
        empty_obs (RockSampleObservation): an empty observation that needs to be filled and returned
    Returns:
        obs (RockSampleObservation): observation of the agent
    """
    obs = copy.deepcopy(empty_obs)
    obs.x = state.x
    obs.y = state.y

    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        rock_idx = action - RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0
        is_good = state.rocks[rock_idx]
        # Add some noise to the observation
        if random.random() < 0.1:  # 10% chance of incorrect observation
            is_good = not is_good
        obs.rock_idx = rock_idx
        obs.is_good = is_good
    else:
        # For all other actions, the observation is null
        obs.rock_idx = None
        obs.is_good = None

    return obs
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Consistent Observation for Check Actions**:
   - The function now always returns an observation with `rock_idx` and a noisy `is_good` reading for `CHECK_ROCK` actions, regardless of the agent's position.
   - This ensures that the observation distribution is consistent with the real-world samples provided.

2. **Noise Model**:
   - The noise model remains the same, with a 10% chance of returning an incorrect observation.

This should better model the true distribution of observations conditioned on the state.
