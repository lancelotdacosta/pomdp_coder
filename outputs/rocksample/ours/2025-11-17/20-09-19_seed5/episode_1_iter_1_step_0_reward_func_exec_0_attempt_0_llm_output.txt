Based on the provided samples, it seems that the reward function should handle the following cases:

1. **Exiting the Environment**:
   - When the agent performs the `EXIT` action, the episode ends (`done=True`), and the agent receives a large positive reward (`10.0`).

2. **Sampling a Rock**:
   - When the agent samples a rock (`SAMPLE` action) at a rock's position, the reward is based on the quality of the rock:
     - If the rock is good, the agent receives a positive reward (`10.0`).
     - If the rock is bad, the agent receives a negative reward (`-1.0`).

3. **Checking a Rock**:
   - When the agent checks a rock (e.g., `CHECK_ROCK_0` or `CHECK_ROCK_1`), there is no immediate reward, but the agent can still be in a valid state.

4. **Other Actions**:
   - For any other actions (e.g., moving, checking a rock), the reward is `0.0` and the episode does not end.

Here is the improved `reward_func` function that better models the true distribution:

```python
def reward_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, next_state: RockSampleState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the current state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """

    # Define the reward and done flags
    reward = 0.0
    done = False
    
    # Check if the action is to sample a rock
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            # If the agent is at a rock and samples it, get a reward based on the rock's quality
            if next_state.rocks[rock_idx]:
                reward = 10.0  # Good rock
            else:
                reward = -1.0  # Bad rock
    
    # Check if the action is to exit the environment
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        reward = 10.0  # Large positive reward for exiting
        done = True  # Episode ends when the agent exits
    
    return reward, done
```

This function now correctly handles the cases where the agent exits the environment or samples a rock, providing the appropriate rewards and done flags based on the provided samples.
