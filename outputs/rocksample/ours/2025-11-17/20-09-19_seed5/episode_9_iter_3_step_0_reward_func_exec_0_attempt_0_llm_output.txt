Certainly! Let's analyze the discrepancies between the observed real-world samples and the outputs from your current model. This will help us understand how to improve the `reward_func` function.

### Analysis of Discrepancies

1. **Sampling at a Rock**:
   - In the real world, sampling a rock can give a positive reward if the rock is bad (i.e., `rocks[rock_idx] == False`), and a negative reward if the rock is good (i.e., `rocks[rock_idx] == True`).
   - Your current model correctly handles this, but it seems to have issues with the transition of the state's rock quality.

2. **Exiting the Grid**:
   - The real world only gives a reward of 10.0 and sets `done` to `True` if the agent exits from the correct positions: `(0, 0)` or `(GRID_SIZE - 1, GRID_SIZE - 1)`.
   - Your model incorrectly gives a reward of 10.0 if the agent exits from any position, regardless of its coordinates.

3. **Checking Rocks**:
   - The real world consistently gives a small negative reward of -1.0 for checking rocks, which your model correctly handles.

### Improved `reward_func`

To address these issues, we need to ensure that:
- The reward for sampling a rock is based on the true state of the rock, and the state should not change after sampling.
- The reward for exiting the grid is only given when the agent exits from the correct positions.

Here is the improved `reward_func`:

```python
def reward_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, next_state: RockSampleState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state-action-next_state transition
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    
    # Check if the agent has exited the grid from the correct position
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        if (state.x, state.y) in [(0, 0), (GRID_SIZE - 1, GRID_SIZE - 1)]:
            return 10.0, True
        else:
            return 0.0, False

    # Check if the agent has sampled a rock
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            if state.rocks[rock_idx]:
                return -10.0, False  # Sampling a good rock gives negative reward
            else:
                return 10.0, False   # Sampling a bad rock gives positive reward
        else:
            return -10.0, False      # Sampling an empty cell gives negative reward

    # Check if the agent performed a CHECK_ROCK action
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        return -1.0, False  # Small negative reward for checking rocks

    # For other actions (move), no reward is given
    return 0.0, False
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Exiting the Grid**:
   - The condition `(state.x, state.y) in [(0, 0), (GRID_SIZE - 1, GRID_SIZE - 1)]` ensures that the reward of 10.0 and `done` set to `True` is only given when the agent exits from the correct positions.

2. **Sampling a Rock**:
   - The reward is based on the true state of the rock (`state.rocks[rock_idx]`), and the state does not change after sampling. This ensures that the transition to `next_state` does not affect the reward calculation.

3. **Checking Rocks**:
   - The reward for checking rocks remains consistent with the real-world behavior, giving a small negative reward of -1.0.

This improved function should better align with the observed real-world samples and provide more accurate rewards and termination conditions.
