You are a robot exploring its environment. 



Your goal is to model the distribution of observations conditioned on a state of the world in python. 

You have tried it before and came up with one partially correct solution, but it is not perfect. 

The observed distribution disagrees with the generated model in several cases.
You need to improve your code to come closer to the true distribution.

Here are some samples from the real world that were impossible under your model
Input RockSampleState: RockSampleState(x=0, y=3, rocks=[B,B])
Input int: 7
Output RockSampleObservation: Obs(x=0, y=3, rock=1, reading=BAD)



And here are some samples from your code under the same conditions
Input RockSampleState: RockSampleState(x=0, y=3, rocks=[B,B])
Input int: 7
Output RockSampleObservation: Obs(x=0,y=3, NULL)





Explain what you believe is the distribution of observations conditioned on a state in english, then improve your code to better model the true distribution.

Please implement the code for the following the template. 
You must implement the ‘ observation_func ‘ function. 

The code needs to be directly runnable with (state) and return a sample (observation). 

Do not output examples. 
Do not create any new classes. 
Do not rewrite existing classes.
Do not import any new modules from anywhere.
Do not list out specific indices that overfit to the examples, but include ranges.
Put the ‘ observation_func ‘ function in a python code block.
#define assistant
Certainly! Let's first explain the distribution of observations conditioned on a state in English:

### Distribution of Observations Conditioned on a State

1. **Position Observations**:
   - The agent always observes its current position `(x, y)`.

2. **Check Rock Actions**:
   - If the agent performs a `CHECK_ROCK` action and is at the rock's position:
     - The agent observes the rock index (`rock_idx`).
     - The agent observes whether the rock is good or bad (`is_good`).
     - There is a 10% chance that the observation is incorrect (i.e., a good rock might be observed as bad and vice versa).
   - If the agent performs a `CHECK_ROCK` action but is not at the rock's position:
     - The agent observes `None` for both `rock_idx` and `is_good`.

3. **Other Actions**:
   - For all other actions, the agent observes `None` for both `rock_idx` and `is_good`.

### Improved Code

Based on the above distribution, let's improve the `observation_func` function to better model the true distribution:

    return obs
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Position Observations**:
   - The agent's position `(x, y)` is always observed correctly.

2. **Check Rock Actions**:
   - If the agent performs a `CHECK_ROCK` action but is not at the rock's position, the `rock_idx` is still set to the index of the rock being checked, and `is_good` is set to `None`. This ensures that the observation is consistent with the action taken, even if the agent is not at the rock's position.

3. **Other Actions**:
   - For all other actions, the `rock_idx` and `is_good` fields are set to `None`.

These changes ensure that the observations generated by the model more accurately reflect the true distribution in the real world.
