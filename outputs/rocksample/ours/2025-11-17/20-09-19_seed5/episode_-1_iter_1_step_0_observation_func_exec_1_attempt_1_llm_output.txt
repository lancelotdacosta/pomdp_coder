The `IndentationError` indicates that there is an issue with the indentation in your code. Specifically, the line `obs.is_good = is_good` is indented incorrectly. Let's ensure that the indentation is consistent and correct throughout the function.

Here is the corrected `observation_func` function with proper indentation:

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Consistent Indentation**:
   - Ensured that all lines are indented correctly and consistently. Specifically, the line `obs.is_good = is_good` is now properly indented within the `if` block.

This should resolve the `IndentationError` and ensure that the code runs correctly. The function now correctly models the distribution of observations conditioned on a state, as described in the problem statement.
