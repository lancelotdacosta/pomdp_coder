Certainly! Let's analyze the reward function based on the provided examples and improve it to better align with the true distribution.

### Analysis

From the samples provided:
1. **Exiting the Grid**: The reward for exiting the grid should only be granted when the agent is at the exit point (0, 0).
2. **Sampling a Rock**: The reward for sampling a rock should be conditional on the rock being good or bad and the agent being at the rock's position.
3. **Checking a Rock**: The reward for checking a rock should be consistent regardless of the rock's position.

### Improvements

1. **Exit Condition**: Ensure that the agent is at the exit point (0, 0) to receive the exit reward.
2. **Sampling a Rock**: Correct the logic to ensure the reward is based on the rock's state and the agent's position.
3. **Checking a Rock**: Ensure the check action reward is consistent.

### Updated Reward Function

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Determine if the agent is at a rock position
    current_rock_idx = state.at_rock()

    # Reward for exiting the grid (reaching the exit point)
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT and state.x == 0 and state.y == 0:
        return 10.0, True

    # Reward for checking a rock
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS and current_rock_idx is not None:
        return -1.0, False

    # Reward for sampling a rock
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        if current_rock_idx is not None:
            if state.rocks[current_rock_idx]:
                return 10.0, True
            else:
                return -10.0, False
        else:
            return 0.0, False

    # No reward for other actions
    return 0.0, False
```

### Explanation

1. **Exit Condition**: The condition `if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT and state.x == 0 and state.y == 0` ensures that the agent receives the exit reward only when it is at the exit point (0, 0).
2. **Sampling a Rock**: The condition `if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE and current_rock_idx is not None` ensures that the agent can sample a rock only if it is at a rock's position. The reward is then based on whether the rock is good or bad.
3. **Checking a Rock**: The condition `if action in CHECK_ACTIONS and current_rock_idx is not None` ensures that the agent receives a consistent -1.0 reward for checking a rock.

This updated reward function should better align with the true distribution of rewards in the environment.
