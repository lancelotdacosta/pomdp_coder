### Explanation of the Reward Function

1. **Exit Action (EXIT)**:
   - If the agent exits the grid and all rocks have been sampled as good (`'G'`), it receives a positive reward of `10.0` and the episode ends.
   - If any rock is bad (`'B'`), the agent receives a negative reward of `-10.0` and the episode ends.

2. **Sample Action (SAMPLE)**:
   - If the agent samples a rock, it checks if the rock at its current position is good (`'G'`) or bad (`'B'`).
   - If the rock is good, it receives a positive reward of `10.0`.
   - If the rock is bad, it receives a negative reward of `-10.0`.
   - If the agent tries to sample but is not at a rock, it receives a small negative reward of `-1.0`.

3. **Check Actions (CHECK_ROCK_0, CHECK_ROCK_1)**:
   - There is no immediate reward for checking a rock. The reward for these actions is `0.0`.

4. **Movement Actions (MOVE_NORTH, MOVE_SOUTH, MOVE_EAST, MOVE_WEST)**:
   - For movement actions, the agent receives a small negative reward of `-1.0` to encourage efficient navigation.

This reward function aims to guide the agent to efficiently navigate the grid, sample good rocks, and exit the grid when all rocks have been sampled correctly.
