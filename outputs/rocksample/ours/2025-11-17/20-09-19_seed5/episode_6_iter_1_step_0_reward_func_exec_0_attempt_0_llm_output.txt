Certainly! Let's break down the reward function based on the observed discrepancies between the real world and the current model.

### Reward Function Explanation

1. **Sampling a Rock**:
   - If the agent samples a rock (`action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE`):
     - If the rock is good, the reward is `10.0`.
     - If the rock is bad, the reward is `-10.0`.

2. **Checking a Rock**:
   - If the agent checks a rock (`action == RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0` or `action == RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_1`):
     - The reward is `-1.0` for checking a rock.

3. **Exiting**:
   - If the agent exits (`action == RockSampleActions.EXIT`):
     - The reward is `0.0` and the episode ends (`done = True`).

4. **Other Actions**:
   - For all other actions (move north, south, east, west):
     - The reward is `0.0` and the episode does not end (`done = False`).

### Improved Reward Function

Based on the above explanation, let's improve the `reward_func` function to better model the true distribution:

```python
def reward_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, next_state: RockSampleState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """

    # The reward is 10 if the agent samples a good rock
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE and next_state.at_rock() is not None and next_state.rocks[next_state.at_rock()]:
        return 10.0, False
    
    # The reward is -10 if the agent samples a bad rock
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE and next_state.at_rock() is not None and not next_state.rocks[next_state.at_rock()]:
        return -10.0, False
    
    # The reward is -1 for checking a rock
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        return -1.0, False
    
    # The episode ends when the agent exits
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        return 0.0, True
    
    # The reward is 0 for all other actions
    if action in [RockSampleActions.MOVE_NORTH, RockSampleActions.MOVE_SOUTH, RockSampleActions.MOVE_EAST, RockSampleActions.MOVE_WEST]:
        return 0.0, False
    
    # Default case: no reward, episode not done
    return 0.0, False
```

This improved `reward_func` should better reflect the true distribution based on the provided discrepancies. It handles the cases where the agent samples or checks a rock and ensures the correct rewards are given in each scenario.
