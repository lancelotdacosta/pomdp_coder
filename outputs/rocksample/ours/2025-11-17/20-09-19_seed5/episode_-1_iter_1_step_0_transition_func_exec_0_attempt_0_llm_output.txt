Certainly! Based on the provided samples from the real world, it seems that the `SAMPLE` action can change the state of the rocks. Specifically, when the agent performs the `SAMPLE` action at a rock's position, there is a possibility that the rock's state might change from `GOOD` to `BAD`.

Let's update the `transition_func` to reflect this behavior. We'll introduce a probabilistic change for the rock's state when the `SAMPLE` action is performed.

Here's the updated `transition_func`:

```python
def transition_func(state, action):
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment 
        action (int): action to be taken in state `state`
    Returns:
        new_state (RockSampleState): the new state of the environment
    """
    new_state = copy.deepcopy(state)
    
    if action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_NORTH:
        if new_state.y < GRID_SIZE - 1:
            new_state.y += 1
    elif action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_SOUTH:
        if new_state.y > 0:
            new_state.y -= 1
    elif action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_EAST:
        if new_state.x < GRID_SIZE - 1:
            new_state.x += 1
    elif action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_WEST:
        if new_state.x > 0:
            new_state.x -= 1
    elif action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = new_state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None and rock_idx < NUM_ROCKS:
            # Sample the rock with a probability of changing its state
            if random.random() < 0.5:  # 50% chance of changing the rock's state
                new_state.rocks = new_state.rocks[:rock_idx] + (False,) + new_state.rocks[rock_idx+1:]
    elif action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        # Exit the environment (this action does not change the state)
        pass
    elif action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        rock_idx = new_state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None and rock_idx < NUM_ROCKS:
            # Check the rock (this action does not change the state)
            pass
    
    return new_state
```

### Explanation:
- **Move Actions (`MOVE_NORTH`, `MOVE_SOUTH`, `MOVE_EAST`, `MOVE_WEST`)**: These actions move the agent to a new position on the grid, if possible.
- **Sample Action (`SAMPLE`)**: When the agent performs this action at a rock's position, there is a 50% chance that the rock's state will change from `GOOD` to `BAD`. This is implemented by generating a random number and comparing it to 0.5.
- **Exit Action (`EXIT`)**: This action does not change the state of the environment.
- **Check Actions (`CHECK_ROCK_0`, `CHECK_ROCK_1`)**: These actions do not change the state of the environment.

This update should better model the true distribution of next states conditioned on actions and previous states.
