Certainly! Let's first explain the distribution of observations conditioned on a state in English:

### Distribution of Observations Conditioned on a State

1. **Position Observations**:
   - The agent always observes its current position `(x, y)`.

2. **Check Rock Actions**:
   - If the agent performs a `CHECK_ROCK` action and is at the rock's position:
     - The agent observes the rock index (`rock_idx`).
     - The agent observes whether the rock is good or bad (`is_good`).
     - There is a 10% chance that the observation is incorrect (i.e., a good rock might be observed as bad and vice versa).
   - If the agent performs a `CHECK_ROCK` action but is not at the rock's position:
     - The agent observes `None` for both `rock_idx` and `is_good`.

3. **Other Actions**:
   - For all other actions, the agent observes `None` for both `rock_idx` and `is_good`.

### Improved Code

Based on the above distribution, let's improve the `observation_func` function to better model the true distribution:

```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Position Observations**:
   - The agent's position `(x, y)` is always observed correctly.

2. **Check Rock Actions**:
   - If the agent performs a `CHECK_ROCK` action but is not at the rock's position, the `rock_idx` is still set to the index of the rock being checked, and `is_good` is set to `None`. This ensures that the observation is consistent with the action taken, even if the agent is not at the rock's position.

3. **Other Actions**:
   - For all other actions, the `rock_idx` and `is_good` fields are set to `None`.

These changes ensure that the observations generated by the model more accurately reflect the true distribution in the real world.
