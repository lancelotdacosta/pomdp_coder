Certainly! Let's analyze the discrepancies between the real-world samples and the model's predictions.

### Analysis

1. **Action `EXIT`**:
   - In the real world, the episode ends (`done = True`) only when the agent is at a rock position and the rock is good.
   - In your current model, the episode always ends (`done = True`) when the agent exits, regardless of the rock state or position.

2. **Action `SAMPLE`**:
   - In the real world, sampling a bad rock gives a reward of -10.0, not -1.0.

3. **General Observations**:
   - The reward for exiting should be 10.0 if the agent is at a rock position and the rock is good.
   - The reward for exiting should be 0.0 if the agent is not at a rock position or if the rock is bad.

### Improved `reward_func` Function

Here is the improved `reward_func` function that better models the true distribution:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    reward = 0.0
    done = False

    # Check if the agent is at a rock
    rock_idx = state.at_rock()

    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        if rock_idx is not None:
            # If the rock was good, the agent gets a positive reward
            if state.rocks[rock_idx]:
                reward = 10.0
                # The rock is now sampled and becomes bad
                next_rocks = list(next_state.rocks)
                next_rocks[rock_idx] = False
                next_state = RockSampleState(next_state.x, next_state.y, tuple(next_rocks))
            else:
                reward = -10.0
        else:
            # Sampling when not at a rock gives a negative reward
            reward = -1.0

    elif action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        # Exiting the environment ends the episode
        done = True
        if rock_idx is not None and state.rocks[rock_idx]:
            reward = 10.0
        else:
            reward = 0.0

    elif action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        # Checking a rock gives no immediate reward, but can provide information
        if rock_idx is not None and action == RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0 + rock_idx:
            # Simulate noisy observation (not implemented here)
            pass
        else:
            # Checking when not at a rock or if the rock is bad gives a negative reward
            reward = -1.0

    return reward, done
```

### Explanation

- **Action `EXIT`**:
  - The episode ends (`done = True`) only if the agent exits.
  - The reward is 10.0 if the agent is at a rock position and the rock is good.
  - The reward is 0.0 if the agent is not at a rock position or if the rock is bad.

- **Action `SAMPLE`**:
  - If the agent samples a good rock, the reward is 10.0 and the rock becomes bad.
  - If the agent samples a bad rock, the reward is -10.0.
  - If the agent samples when not at a rock, the reward is -1.0.

This should better align with the observed distribution from the real world.
