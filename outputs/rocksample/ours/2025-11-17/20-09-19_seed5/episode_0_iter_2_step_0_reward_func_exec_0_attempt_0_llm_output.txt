Certainly! Based on the observations and the discrepancies between the real world and the generated model, it appears that the reward function is not correctly handling certain actions, particularly the `CHECK` and `EXIT` actions, as well as the `SAMPLE` action when the agent is not at a rock.

Here's an improved version of the `reward_func` function that better models the true distribution:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    reward = 0.0
    done = False

    # Check if the agent is at a rock
    rock_idx = state.at_rock()

    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        if rock_idx is not None:
            # If the rock was good, the agent gets a positive reward
            if state.rocks[rock_idx]:
                reward = 10.0
                # The rock is now sampled and becomes bad
                next_rocks = list(next_state.rocks)
                next_rocks[rock_idx] = False
                next_state = RockSampleState(next_state.x, next_state.y, tuple(next_rocks))
            else:
                reward = -10.0  # Sampling a bad rock gives a negative reward
        else:
            # Sampling when not at a rock gives a negative reward
            reward = -1.0

    elif action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        # Exiting the environment ends the episode
        done = True

    elif action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        # Checking a rock gives no immediate reward, but can provide information
        if rock_idx is not None and action == RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0 + rock_idx:
            # Simulate noisy observation (not implemented here)
            pass
        else:
            # Checking when not at a rock gives a negative reward
            reward = -1.0

    return reward, done
```

### Explanation:
1. **Sampling Action (`action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE`)**:
   - If the agent is at a rock (`rock_idx is not None`):
     - If the rock is good (`state.rocks[rock_idx]`), the agent gets a positive reward of `10.0`.
     - If the rock is bad, the agent gets a negative reward of `-10.0`.
   - If the agent is not at a rock, the reward is `-1.0`.

2. **Exit Action (`action == RockSampleActions.EXIT`)**:
   - The episode ends (`done = True`).

3. **Check Actions (`action in CHECK_ACTIONS`)**:
   - If the agent is at a rock and performs the correct check action (`action == RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0 + rock_idx`), no immediate reward is given.
   - If the agent is not at a rock or performs an incorrect check action, the reward is `-1.0`.

This should better align with the observed behavior in the real world samples you provided.
