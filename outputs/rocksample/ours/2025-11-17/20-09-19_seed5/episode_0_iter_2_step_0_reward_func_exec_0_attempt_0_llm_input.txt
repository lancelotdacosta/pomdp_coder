#define system
You are a robot exploring its environment. 



Your goal is to model the reward conditioned on state, action, next state transition of the world in python. 

You have tried it before and came up with one partially correct solution, but it is not perfect. 

The observed distribution disagrees with the generated model in several cases.
You need to improve your code to come closer to the true distribution.

Explain what you believe is the reward conditioned on state, action, next state transition in english, then improve your code to better model the true distribution.

Please implement the code for the following the template. 
You must implement the ‘ reward_func ‘ function. 

The code needs to be directly runnable with (state, action, next_state) and return (reward, done). 

Do not output examples. 
Do not create any new classes. 
Do not rewrite existing classes.
Do not import any new modules from anywhere.
Do not list out specific indices that overfit to the examples, but include ranges.
Put the ‘ reward_func ‘ function in a python code block.
