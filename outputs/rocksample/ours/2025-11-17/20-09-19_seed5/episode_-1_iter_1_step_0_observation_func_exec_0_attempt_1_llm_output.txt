It looks like the `enum` module was not imported properly. Let's ensure that all necessary imports are included and the code is correctly structured.

Here is the corrected code with the necessary import for the `enum` module:

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Import `enum`**:
   - Added the import statement for the `enum` module to ensure that `RockSampleActions` can be defined correctly.

2. **Correct Variable Name**:
   - Fixed the variable name `isGood` to `is_good` in the line where the noisy observation is set. This ensures consistency with the variable names used elsewhere in the code.

This should resolve the `NameError` and ensure that the code runs correctly.
