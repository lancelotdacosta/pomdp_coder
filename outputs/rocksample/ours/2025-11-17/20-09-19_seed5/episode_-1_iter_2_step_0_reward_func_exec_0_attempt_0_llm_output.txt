Certainly! Let's analyze the discrepancies between the real-world samples and the current model.

### Analysis

1. **Check Actions (CHECK_ROCK_0, CHECK_ROCK_1)**:
   - The real world seems to give a reward of `-1.0` for check actions when the agent is not at the rock's position.
   - The current model gives a reward of `0.0` for these actions regardless of the agent's position.

2. **Exit Action (EXIT)**:
   - The real world gives a reward of `10.0` and ends the episode only if the agent is at the exit location `(0, 0)`.
   - The current model gives a reward of `10.0` and ends the episode regardless of the agent's position.

### Improved Reward Function

Based on the analysis, we need to adjust the reward function to match the real-world behavior:

1. For check actions, give a reward of `-1.0` if the agent is not at the rock's position.
2. For the exit action, give a reward of `10.0` and end the episode only if the agent is at the exit location `(0, 0)`.

Here is the improved `reward_func`:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Determine if the agent has reached the exit location (0, 0)
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        if next_state.x == 0 and next_state.y == 0:
            return 10.0, True
        else:
            return 0.0, False

    # Check if the agent samples a rock
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None and state.rocks[rock_idx]:
            return 10.0, False
        else:
            return -10.0, False

    # Check if the agent performs a check action
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        rock_idx = action - RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0
        if rock_idx < len(state.rocks):
            if state.at_rock() == rock_idx:
                return 0.0, False
            else:
                return -1.0, False
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid check action index")

    # For all other actions, the reward is 0.0 and the episode is not done
    return 0.0, False
```

This updated `reward_func` should better match the observed behavior from the real world.
