Certainly! Let's analyze the problem and correct the `reward_func` function to better match the observed behavior from the real world.

### Explanation of Reward Function Behavior

1. **Sampling a Rock:**
   - If the agent is at a rock position and samples it (`SAMPLE` action):
     - If the rock is good, the reward is +10 and the episode continues.
     - If the rock is bad, the reward is -10 and the episode continues.
   - If the agent is not at a rock position and samples it:
     - The reward is -1 and the episode continues.

2. **Exiting the Environment:**
   - If the agent exits the environment (`EXIT` action):
     - If the agent is at a rock position:
       - If the rock is bad, the reward is +10 and the episode ends.
       - If the rock is good, the reward is 0 and the episode ends.
     - If the agent is not at a rock position:
       - The reward is 0 and the episode ends.

3. **Checking a Rock:**
   - If the agent checks a rock (`CHECK_ROCK_*` actions):
     - If the agent is at the correct rock position:
       - The reward is 0 and the episode continues.
     - If the agent is not at the correct rock position:
       - The reward is -1 and the episode continues.

4. **Movement Actions:**
   - For movement actions (`MOVE_NORTH`, `MOVE_SOUTH`, `MOVE_EAST`, `MOVE_WEST`):
     - The reward is 0 and the episode continues, regardless of whether the agent moves or stays in the same position.

### Improved `reward_func` Function

Let's implement the corrected `reward_func` function based on the above analysis:

```python
def reward_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, next_state: RockSampleState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Determine if the agent is at a rock position
    rock_idx = state.at_rock()

    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        if rock_idx is not None:
            if state.rocks[rock_idx]:  # Good rock
                return 10.0, False
            else:  # Bad rock
                return -10.0, False
        else:
            return -1.0, False  # No rock to sample

    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        if rock_idx is not None:
            if not state.rocks[rock_idx]:  # Bad rock
                return 10.0, True
            else:  # Good rock
                return 0.0, True
        else:
            return 0.0, True  # Not at a rock position

    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        if (action == RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0 and rock_idx != 0) or (action == RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_1 and rock_idx != 1):
            return -1.0, False  # Checking a rock that is not present at the position
        else:
            return 0.0, False  # Valid check

    if action in [RockSampleActions.MOVE_NORTH, RockSampleActions.MOVE_SOUTH, RockSampleActions.MOVE_EAST, RockSampleActions.MOVE_WEST]:
        return 0.0, False  # Movement reward

    return 0.0, False  # Default case
```

This function should now better match the observed behavior from the real world. The key changes are:
- Ensuring that the `EXIT` action only provides a reward when at a rock position and correctly ends the episode.
- Ensuring that `CHECK_ROCK_*` actions provide the correct reward based on the agent's position relative to the rock being checked.
- Ensuring that `SAMPLE` actions provide the correct reward based on the presence and quality of the rock.
