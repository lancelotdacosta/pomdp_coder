Based on the provided samples, it appears that the distribution of observations conditioned on a state is as follows:

- The `x` and `y` coordinates of the observation always match the agent's current position in the state.
- For actions other than `CHECK_ROCK_0` and `CHECK_ROCK_1`, the `rock_idx` and `is_good` fields are always `None`.
- For `CHECK_ROCK_0` and `CHECK_ROCK_1` actions, the `rock_idx` field is set to the corresponding rock index (0 or 1), and the `is_good` field is a noisy reading of the rock's quality. The noise can be modeled as a simple Bernoulli trial with a certain probability of error.

Given this understanding, here is the implementation of the `observation_func` function:
