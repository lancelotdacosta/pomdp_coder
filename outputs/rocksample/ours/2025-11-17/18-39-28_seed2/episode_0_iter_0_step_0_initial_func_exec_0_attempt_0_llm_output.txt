Based on the provided samples, the distribution of initial states seems to follow these patterns:

1. **Agent's Position (x, y)**:
   - The agent can start at various positions within the grid, including (0, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), and (2, 1).
   - The positions are uniformly distributed across the grid, with no specific bias towards any particular cell.

2. **Rock States**:
   - There are two rocks, and each rock can be either good (G) or bad (B).
   - The rock states are also uniformly distributed, with no specific pattern or bias.

To model this distribution, we will use random selection for both the agent's position and the rock states. Here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: RockSampleState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (RockSampleState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (RockSampleState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define possible initial positions for the agent
    possible_positions = [(0, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1)]

    # Randomly select an initial position for the agent
    x, y = random.choice(possible_positions)

    # Define possible states for each rock (good or bad)
    possible_rock_states = [True, False]  # True = G, False = B

    # Randomly generate the state for each rock
    rocks = tuple(random.choice(possible_rock_states) for _ in range(NUM_ROCKS))

    # Create and return the initial state
    initial_state = RockSampleState(x=x, y=y, rocks=rocks)
    return initial_state
```

This function ensures that the initial state is generated according to the observed distribution, with random selection for both the agent's position and the rock states.
