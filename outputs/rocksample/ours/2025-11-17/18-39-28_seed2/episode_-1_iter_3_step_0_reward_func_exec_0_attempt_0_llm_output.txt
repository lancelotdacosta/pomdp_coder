Based on the provided samples and the discrepancies between the real world and the generated model, it seems that the reward function is not correctly handling certain edge cases. Specifically:

1. The `CHECK_ROCK` actions should incur a penalty (-1.0) if the agent is not at the corresponding rock position.
2. The `EXIT` action should only provide a reward and mark the episode as done if the agent is at the exit location (which is typically the start location, e.g., (0, 0)).
3. The `SAMPLE` action should only provide a reward if the agent is at a rock position and the rock is good.

Let's improve the `reward_func` to better model these conditions:

```python
def reward_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, next_state: RockSampleState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """

    # Check if the agent has taken the exit action
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        # Only provide reward and mark as done if the agent is at the exit location (0, 0)
        if (state.x, state.y) == (0, 0):
            return 10.0, True
        else:
            return 0.0, False

    # Check if the agent has sampled a rock
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            if state.rocks[rock_idx] == True:
                return 10.0, False
            else:
                return -10.0, False
        else:
            return 0.0, False

    # Check if the agent has performed a check rock action and is not at the corresponding rock
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        rock_idx = action - RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0
        if (state.x, state.y) != ROCK_POSITIONS[rock_idx]:
            return -1.0, False
        else:
            return 0.0, False

    # Check if the agent has moved or taken any other action
    if action in [RockSampleActions.MOVE_NORTH, RockSampleActions.MOVE_SOUTH, 
                  RockSampleActions.MOVE_EAST, RockSampleActions.MOVE_WEST]:
        return 0.0, False

    # Default case for any other actions
    return 0.0, False
```

### Explanation:
1. **Exit Action**: The `EXIT` action now checks if the agent is at the exit location (0, 0). If so, it provides a reward of 10.0 and marks the episode as done. Otherwise, it returns 0.0 and does not mark the episode as done.
2. **Sample Action**: The `SAMPLE` action checks if the agent is at a rock position. If the rock is good, it provides a reward of 10.0; if the rock is bad, it provides a reward of -10.0. If the agent is not at a rock position, it returns 0.0.
3. **Check Rock Actions**: The `CHECK_ROCK` actions now check if the agent is at the corresponding rock position. If not, they return a penalty of -1.0. If the agent is at the rock position, they return 0.0.
4. **Other Actions**: All other actions (such as moving) return 0.0 and do not mark the episode as done.

This should better align with the observed distribution from the real world.
