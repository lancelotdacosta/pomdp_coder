### Explanation of the Distribution of Next States Conditioned on Actions and Previous States

1. **Movement Actions**:
   - **MOVE_NORTH**: The agent moves one step north, but it cannot move beyond the grid boundary (y=0).
   - **MOVE_SOUTH**: The agent moves one step south, but it cannot move beyond the grid boundary (y=GRID_SIZE-1).
   - **MOVE_EAST**: The agent moves one step east, but it cannot move beyond the grid boundary (x=GRID_SIZE-1).
   - **MOVE_WEST**: The agent moves one step west, but it cannot move beyond the grid boundary (x=0).

2. **Sample Action**:
   - If the agent is at a rock's position, sampling the rock changes its state from good (True) to bad (False). The rock's index is determined by checking if the agent's current position matches any rock position in `ROCK_POSITIONS`.

3. **Exit Action**:
   - The EXIT action does not change the state of the environment.

4. **Check Actions**:
   - CHECK_ROCK_0 and CHECK_ROCK_1 actions do not change the state of the environment. They are used for observations, which are not relevant to the state transition.

This implementation ensures that the transition function correctly models the next state based on the given action and the current state of the environment.
