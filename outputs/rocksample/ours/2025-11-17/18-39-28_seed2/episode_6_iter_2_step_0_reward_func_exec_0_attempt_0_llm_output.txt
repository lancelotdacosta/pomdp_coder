Certainly! Let's analyze the discrepancies and correct the `reward_func` function to better model the true distribution.

### Analysis of Discrepancies

1. **Exiting the Grid**:
   - The exit action should only provide a reward if the agent is at the exit position `(0, 0)`.
   - Your current implementation correctly handles this case.

2. **Sampling a Rock**:
   - If the agent samples a rock, it should receive a reward based on whether the rock is good or bad.
   - Your current implementation correctly handles this case.

3. **Checking a Rock**:
   - If the agent checks a rock but is not at the rock's position, it should receive a penalty.
   - Your current implementation correctly handles this case.

4. **Exit Action**:
   - The exit action should provide a reward of 10.0 and mark the episode as done if the agent is at any position in the grid.
   - This is a discrepancy in your current implementation. The exit action should always provide a reward of 10.0 and mark the episode as done, regardless of the agent's position.

### Corrected `reward_func` Function

Here is the improved `reward_func` function:

```python
def reward_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, next_state: RockSampleState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    
    # Check if the agent has exited the grid
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        return 10.0, True

    # Check if the agent is sampling a rock
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            if state.rocks[rock_idx]:  # Good rock
                return 10.0, False
            else:  # Bad rock
                return -10.0, False
        else:
            return -1.0, False  # Sampling but not at a rock

    # Check if the agent is checking a rock
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        rock_idx = action - RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0
        if (state.x, state.y) == ROCK_POSITIONS[rock_idx]:
            return 0.0, False
        else:
            return -1.0, False  # Checking but not at a rock

    # Default reward for moving actions
    return 0.0, False
```

### Explanation

1. **Exiting the Grid**:
   - The exit action now always provides a reward of 10.0 and marks the episode as done, regardless of the agent's position.

2. **Sampling a Rock**:
   - The logic remains the same: if the agent is at a rock and samples it, the reward depends on whether the rock is good or bad. If the agent samples but is not at a rock, a penalty of -1.0 is given.

3. **Checking a Rock**:
   - The logic remains the same: if the agent checks a rock but is not at its position, a penalty of -1.0 is given.

4. **Moving Actions**:
   - For all other actions (moving actions), the default reward is 0.0 and the episode is not marked as done.

This should better align with the observed distribution from the real world.
