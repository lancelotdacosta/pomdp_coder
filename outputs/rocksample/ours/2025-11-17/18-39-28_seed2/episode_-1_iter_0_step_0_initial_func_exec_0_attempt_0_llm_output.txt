Based on the provided samples, it appears that the initial state distribution for the RockSample problem has the following characteristics:

1. The agent's initial position `(x, y)` can be any of the provided positions: `(0, 0)`, `(1, 2)`, `(0, 4)`, `(2, 1)`.
2. The rocks' status (good or bad) is fixed and consistent across all samples. Specifically, the first rock at position `(1, 1)` can be either good or bad, and the second rock at position `(1, 4)` can also be either good or bad.

Given this, we can model the initial state distribution by randomly selecting one of the provided initial positions and assigning the rocks a status based on the observed distribution.

Here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: RockSampleState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (RockSampleState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (RockSampleState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # List of possible initial positions
    possible_positions = [(0, 0), (1, 2), (0, 4), (2, 1)]
    
    # Randomly select an initial position
    x, y = random.choice(possible_positions)
    
    # Define the possible rock states
    rock_states = [
        (False, False),  # (B, B)
        (True, False),   # (G, B)
        (False, True),   # (B, G)
    ]
    
    # Randomly select a rock state
    rocks = random.choice(rock_states)
    
    # Create and return the initial state
    return RockSampleState(x=x, y=y, rocks=rocks)
```

This function will generate an initial state by randomly selecting one of the provided positions and one of the observed rock states. This should capture the distribution seen in the samples provided.
