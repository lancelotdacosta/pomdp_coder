Certainly! Let's refine the `reward_func` function to better match the observed distribution from the real world.

### Explanation of the Reward Function

1. **Exit Action**: The agent should receive a reward of 10.0 and the episode should end if the agent performs the exit action at the (4, 4) location. If the agent performs the exit action at any other location, it should receive a penalty of -1.0 and the episode should not end.

2. **Sample Action**: If the agent performs the sample action at a rock location, it should receive a reward based on the quality of the rock:
   - +10.0 if the rock is good.
   - -10.0 if the rock is bad.
   If the agent performs the sample action but is not at a rock location, it should receive a penalty of -1.0.

3. **Movement Actions**: The agent should receive no reward for performing movement actions (north, south, east, west).

4. **Check Actions**: The agent should receive no reward for performing check actions, regardless of its position.

5. **Other Actions**: Any other actions should result in a penalty of -1.0.

### Improved `reward_func` Function

Here's the improved `reward_func` function:

```python
def reward_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, next_state: RockSampleState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Check if the action is the exit action
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        if state.x == 4 and state.y == 4:
            return 10.0, True
        else:
            return -1.0, False

    # Check if the action is a sample action
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            if next_state.rocks[rock_idx]:  # If the rock is good
                return 10.0, False
            else:  # If the rock is bad
                return -10.0, False
        else:
            return -1.0, False

    # Check if the action is a movement action
    if action in [RockSampleActions.MOVE_NORTH, RockSampleActions.MOVE_SOUTH, RockSampleActions.MOVE_EAST, RockSampleActions.MOVE_WEST]:
        return 0.0, False

    # Check if the action is a check action
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        return 0.0, False

    # Default case: unexpected action or state transition
    return -1.0, False
```

This function should now more accurately reflect the observed distribution from the real world. The key changes are:

1. Ensuring that the exit action only gives a reward of 10.0 and ends the episode if the agent is at (4, 4).
2. Ensuring that the sample action gives appropriate rewards based on the rock's quality and whether the agent is at a rock location.
3. Ensuring that movement and check actions give no reward.
4. Handling any other actions with a penalty of -1.0.
