Certainly! Let's analyze the discrepancies between the real-world samples and the current model to understand the true reward structure.

### Analysis of Discrepancies

1. **CHECK_ROCK Actions (6, 7):**
   - In the real world, if the agent checks a rock (`CHECK_ROCK_0` or `CHECK_ROCK_1`) and is at the rock's position, the reward is `-1.0` and `done` is `False`.
   - In the current model, these actions always return `0.0` and `False`.

2. **EXIT Action (5):**
   - In the real world, if the agent takes the `EXIT` action but is not at the exit position `(0, 0)`, the reward is `0.0` and `done` is `False`.
   - In the current model, the `EXIT` action always returns `10.0` and `True` regardless of the agent's position.

### Improved Reward Function

Based on the analysis, we need to modify the reward function to account for these conditions:

1. **CHECK_ROCK Actions:**
   - Return `-1.0` and `False` if the agent is at the rock's position.
   - Return `0.0` and `False` otherwise.

2. **EXIT Action:**
   - Return `10.0` and `True` if the agent is at the exit position `(0, 0)`.
   - Return `0.0` and `False` otherwise.

3. **SAMPLE Action:**
   - Return `10.0` and `False` if the agent samples a good rock.
   - Return `-1.0` and `False` if the agent samples a bad rock or is not at a rock's position.

4. **Other Actions:**
   - Return `0.0` and `False`.

Here is the improved `reward_func` function:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    
    # Check if the agent has taken the exit action
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        if state.x == 0 and state.y == 0:
            return 10.0, True
        else:
            return 0.0, False

    # Check if the agent has sampled a rock
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            if state.rocks[rock_idx]:
                return 10.0, False
            else:
                return -1.0, False
        else:
            return -1.0, False

    # Check if the agent has checked a rock
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        rock_idx = action - RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0
        if rock_idx < NUM_ROCKS and (state.x, state.y) == ROCK_POSITIONS[rock_idx]:
            return -1.0, False
        else:
            return 0.0, False

    # Default case for any other actions
    return 0.0, False
```

This function should now better model the true reward distribution based on the provided real-world samples.
