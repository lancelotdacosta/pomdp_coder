Based on the provided samples, it appears that the reward function should consider the following conditions:

1. **Exit Action**:
   - If the agent performs the `EXIT` action, the episode ends with a reward of 10 if all rocks have been sampled and are good (`G`). If any rock is bad (`B`), the reward is 0.

2. **Sample Action**:
   - If the agent performs the `SAMPLE` action and is at a rock's position, it receives a reward based on the quality of the rock. A good rock (`G`) gives a reward of 10, and a bad rock (`B`) gives a reward of -10.
   - If the agent is not at a rock's position when performing the `SAMPLE` action, the reward is 0.

3. **Check Rock Actions**:
   - If the agent performs a `CHECK_ROCK_*` action, it receives a small penalty of -1, regardless of whether it is at a rock's position or not.

4. **Other Actions**:
   - For all other actions (move, check), there is no immediate reward.

Based on this understanding, I will improve the `reward_func` function to better model the true distribution.

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Define the reward based on the action and the resulting state transition
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        # If the agent exits, the episode ends with a reward of 10 if no rocks are bad
        reward = 10.0 if all(rock for rock in state.rocks) else 0.0
        done = True
    elif action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        # If the agent samples a rock, it gets a reward based on the quality of the rock
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            reward = 10.0 if state.rocks[rock_idx] else -10.0
            done = False
        else:
            reward = 0.0
            done = False
    elif action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        # If the agent performs a check rock action, it receives a small penalty
        reward = -1.0
        done = False
    else:
        # For all other actions (move), there is no immediate reward
        reward = 0.0
        done = False

    return reward, done
```

This updated `reward_func` function should better align with the observed samples from the real world. It correctly handles the exit action, the sample action, and introduces a penalty for check rock actions.
