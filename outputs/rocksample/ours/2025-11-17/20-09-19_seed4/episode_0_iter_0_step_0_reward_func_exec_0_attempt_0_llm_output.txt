Certainly! Based on the provided environment samples, it appears that the reward is primarily conditioned on the action taken and the state transition. Here's an English explanation:

1. **Movement Actions** (`MOVE_NORTH`, `MOVE_SOUTH`, `MOVE_EAST`, `MOVE_WEST`): These actions generally do not yield any immediate reward. The primary goal is to navigate the grid without directly earning rewards for movement.
2. **Sampling Action** (`SAMPLE`): This action also does not yield a reward based on the provided samples. However, it could potentially interact with the rocks, but we don't have enough information to determine if this action has a specific reward condition.
3. **Exit Action** (`EXIT`): This action is not present in the samples, but it might be used to end the episode and could potentially yield a reward depending on the state of the environment.
4. **Check Rock Actions** (`CHECK_ROCK_0`, `CHECK_ROCK_1`): These actions do not yield any immediate reward based on the provided samples. They are likely used for gathering information about the quality of the rocks.

Given these observations, the reward function can be implemented as follows:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Default reward and done flag
    reward = 0.0
    done = False

    # Handle movement actions
    if action in [RockSampleActions.MOVE_NORTH, RockSampleActions.MOVE_SOUTH, RockSampleActions.MOVE_EAST, RockSampleActions.MOVE_WEST]:
        # No immediate reward for movement actions
        pass

    # Handle sampling action
    elif action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        # No immediate reward for sampling action based on provided samples
        pass

    # Handle exit action (not present in samples, but for completeness)
    elif action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        # This could be a terminal action with potential reward
        done = True
        # Reward could be based on the state of the rocks or other conditions
        # For now, no specific reward condition is provided
        pass

    # Handle check rock actions
    elif action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        # No immediate reward for checking rock based on provided samples
        pass

    return reward, done
```

This implementation ensures that the reward function is directly runnable and returns the appropriate `reward` and `done` values based on the provided environment samples. The function can be extended as more information becomes available about the specific conditions under which rewards are given and episodes are terminated.
