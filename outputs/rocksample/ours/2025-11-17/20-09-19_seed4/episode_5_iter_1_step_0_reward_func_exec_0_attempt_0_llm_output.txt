Based on the discrepancies between the real-world samples and the generated model, it seems that the reward function is more nuanced than initially implemented. Specifically, the following observations can be made:

1. **Checking Rocks**: When the agent checks a rock, it receives a small negative reward of -1.0, regardless of whether the rock is good or bad.
2. **Sampling Bad Rocks**: Sampling a bad rock results in a larger negative reward of -10.0, not -5.0.
3. **Exiting the Environment**: Exiting the environment should terminate the episode, but it should only provide a reward of 0.0 if the agent is not at a specific exit position.

Given these observations, let's improve the `reward_func` function to better model the true distribution:

```python
def reward_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, next_state: RockSampleState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    reward = 0.0
    done = False

    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            if state.rocks[rock_idx]:
                # If the agent samples a good rock, it gets a positive reward
                reward = 10.0
            else:
                # If the agent samples a bad rock, it gets a larger negative reward
                reward = -10.0
        else:
            # If the agent samples but there is no rock, it gets a smaller negative reward
            reward = -5.0

    elif action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        # When checking a rock, the agent receives a small negative reward
        reward = -1.0

    elif action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        # If the agent exits, the episode is done
        done = True

    return reward, done
```

This updated `reward_func` function addresses the issues observed in the real-world samples:

- **Checking Rocks**: The agent receives a small negative reward of -1.0 when checking a rock.
- **Sampling Bad Rocks**: Sampling a bad rock now results in a larger negative reward of -10.0.
- **Exiting the Environment**: The episode is terminated when the agent exits, but the reward remains 0.0.

This should bring the model closer to the true distribution of rewards in the environment.
