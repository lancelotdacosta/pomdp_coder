Certainly! Let's break down the reward function based on the provided examples and the environment description.

### Reward Conditions:
1. **EXIT Action**:
   - If the agent performs the EXIT action, it should receive a reward of 10.0 and the episode should end (`done = True`).

2. **SAMPLE Action**:
   - If the agent performs the SAMPLE action at a rock and the rock is good, it should receive a reward of 10.0 and the episode continues (`done = False`).
   - If the agent performs the SAMPLE action at a rock and the rock is bad, it should receive a reward of -10.0 and the episode continues (`done = False`).
   - If the agent performs the SAMPLE action but is not at a rock, it should receive a reward of 0.0 and the episode continues (`done = False`).

3. **CHECK Actions**:
   - If the agent performs a CHECK action (e.g., CHECK_ROCK_0 or CHECK_ROCK_1) at the corresponding rock, it should receive a reward of -1.0 and the episode continues (`done = False`).
   - If the agent performs a CHECK action but is not at the corresponding rock, it should receive a reward of 0.0 and the episode continues (`done = False`).

4. **Other Actions**:
   - For all other actions (MOVE_NORTH, MOVE_SOUTH, MOVE_EAST, MOVE_WEST), no reward is given (`reward = 0.0`) and the episode continues (`done = False`).

### Improved Reward Function

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    
    # Check if the agent has exited the grid
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        return 10.0, True

    # Check if the agent has sampled a rock
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            if next_state.rocks[rock_idx]:
                return 10.0, False
            else:
                return -10.0, False
        else:
            return 0.0, False

    # Check if the agent has performed a CHECK action
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        rock_idx = action - RockSampleActions.CHECK_ROCK_0
        if (state.x, state.y) == ROCK_POSITIONS[rock_idx]:
            return -1.0, False
        else:
            return 0.0, False

    # For all other actions, no reward is given
    return 0.0, False
```

This improved function should align better with the observed samples from the real world. It correctly handles the EXIT action, the SAMPLE action for both good and bad rocks, and the CHECK actions at the appropriate rock positions.
