Based on the samples provided, it seems that the real-world observations have a different distribution of readings compared to the current model. Specifically, the current model always provides a 50% chance of a correct reading, which does not match the observed data.

### Distribution of Observations Conditioned on a State:
- **Position and Rock Index**: The robot's position and the rock index (if applicable) are always correctly reported in the observation.
- **Reading Accuracy**:
  - If the rock is **BAD**, the observation should report **BAD** with a higher probability (e.g., 75%).
  - If the rock is **GOOD**, the observation should report **GOOD** with a higher probability (e.g., 75%).

### Improved `observation_func`:
To better model the true distribution, we will adjust the probability of correct readings for each rock type. Specifically, we will use a 75% chance of a correct reading and a 25% chance of an incorrect reading.

This updated `observation_func` should better reflect the true distribution of observations conditioned on the state, with a higher probability of correct readings for both GOOD and BAD rocks.
