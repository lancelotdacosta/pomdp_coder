Based on the provided samples, it appears that the environment is wrapping around the grid, but there are some inconsistencies in how the wrapping is handled. Specifically, the correct behavior seems to be that when the agent moves off one edge of the grid, it re-enters from the opposite edge, maintaining the same x or y coordinate as appropriate.

To better model the true distribution, we need to ensure that the wrapping behavior is consistent for all actions. Here's the improved `transition_func`:

```python
def transition_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int) -> RockSampleState:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment 
        action (int): action to be taken in state `state`
    Returns:
        new_state (RockSampleState): the new state of the environment
    """
    x, y = state.x, state.y
    rocks = list(state.rocks)
    
    if action in [RockSampleActions.MOVE_NORTH, RockSampleActions.MOVE_SOUTH,
                  RockSampleActions.MOVE_EAST, RockSampleActions.MOVE_WEST]:
        # Calculate new position based on action
        if action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_NORTH:
            y = (y - 1) % GRID_SIZE  # Wrap around the grid
        elif action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_SOUTH:
            y = (y + 1) % GRID_SIZE  # Wrap around the grid
        elif action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_EAST:
            x = (x + 1) % GRID_SIZE  # Wrap around the grid
        elif action == RockSampleActions.MOVE_WEST:
            x = (x - 1) % GRID_SIZE  # Wrap around the grid
    
    elif action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            rocks[rock_idx] = False  # Sample the rock, changing its state to bad
    
    elif action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        # Exit action does not change the state
        pass
    
    # Create new state with updated position and rock states
    new_state = RockSampleState(x, y, tuple(rocks))
    return new_state
```

### Explanation of the Changes

1. **Wrapping Behavior Consistency**:
   - The wrapping behavior for all move actions (`MOVE_NORTH`, `MOVE_SOUTH`, `MOVE_EAST`, `MOVE_WEST`) is consistent and uses the modulo operator to ensure the agent re-enters the grid from the opposite edge.
   - The `y` coordinate wraps around the grid height (`GRID_SIZE`) when moving north or south.
   - The `x` coordinate wraps around the grid width (`GRID_SIZE`) when moving east or west.

2. **No Changes to Other Actions**:
   - The `SAMPLE` action correctly updates the rock state if the agent is at a rock.
   - The `EXIT` action does not change the state, as expected.

This implementation should now accurately model the true distribution of next states conditioned on actions and previous states, based on the provided samples and the environment description.
