Based on the provided samples, it appears that the initial state distribution for the RockSample environment is as follows:

1. **Agent Position**: The agent's starting position `(x, y)` seems to be uniformly distributed across the grid, except for positions that are walls or rock positions.
2. **Rock States**: The rocks can be either "Good" (G) or "Bad" (B). The state of each rock is independently chosen with equal probability.

Given this understanding, we can model the initial state distribution as follows:

- Randomly select an initial position `(x, y)` from the grid, ensuring it is not a wall or a rock position.
- Independently set each rock's state to "Good" or "Bad" with equal probability.

Here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: RockSampleState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (RockSampleState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (RockSampleState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    
    def is_valid_position(x, y):
        """Check if the position (x, y) is valid (i.e., not a wall or a rock position)."""
        return (0 <= x < GRID_SIZE and 0 <= y < GRID_SIZE) and (x, y) not in ROCK_POSITIONS

    # Generate a valid initial position for the agent
    while True:
        x = random.randint(0, GRID_SIZE - 1)
        y = random.randint(0, GRID_SIZE - 1)
        if is_valid_position(x, y):
            break

    # Generate the state of the rocks
    rocks = tuple(random.choice([True, False]) for _ in range(NUM_ROCKS))

    # Return the initial state
    return RockSampleState(x=x, y=y, rocks=rocks)
```

This function ensures that the agent's initial position is randomly chosen from the grid, avoiding walls and rock positions. It also randomly assigns each rock a "Good" or "Bad" state with equal probability.
