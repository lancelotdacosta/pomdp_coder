Certainly! Let's analyze the discrepancies and adjust the `reward_func` accordingly.

### Analysis:
1. **EXIT Action:**
   - The current implementation assumes that if the agent exits, the episode ends immediately, and the reward is 10.0 if all rocks are good, otherwise 0.0.
   - The observed data shows that the episode does not always end when the agent exits, suggesting that the exit action might have additional conditions or randomness.

2. **SAMPLE Action:**
   - The current implementation rewards based on the quality of the rock at the agent's position.
   - The observed data shows that the episode does not always end when the agent samples a rock.

3. **General Observations:**
   - The `done` flag should not always be `True` for the EXIT action.
   - The `done` flag should not always be `False` for other actions.

### Improved Reward Function:
We need to introduce some probabilistic behavior or additional conditions to match the observed data more closely. Here's the improved `reward_func`:

```python
def reward_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, next_state: RockSampleState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    # Define the reward based on the action and the resulting state transition
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        # If the agent exits, the episode ends with a reward of 10 if no rocks are bad
        if all(rock for rock in state.rocks):
            reward = 10.0
        else:
            reward = 0.0
        # Introduce some randomness to match the observed data
        done = random.random() < 0.8  # 80% chance of ending the episode
    elif action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        # If the agent samples a rock, it gets a reward based on the quality of the rock
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            reward = 10.0 if state.rocks[rock_idx] else -10.0
            # The episode might or might not end after sampling
            done = random.random() < 0.5  # 50% chance of ending the episode
        else:
            reward = 0.0
            done = False
    elif action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        # If the agent performs a check rock action, it receives a small penalty
        reward = -1.0
        done = False
    else:
        # For all other actions (move), there is no immediate reward
        reward = 0.0
        done = False

    return reward, done
```

### Explanation:
- **EXIT Action:**
  - The episode ends with an 80% probability when the agent exits. This introduces some variability to match the observed data.
- **SAMPLE Action:**
  - The episode ends with a 50% probability after sampling a rock. This also introduces variability to match the observed data.
- **CHECK Actions:**
  - No changes needed here as the observed data matches the current behavior.

This should better model the true distribution of rewards and episode termination based on the provided examples.
