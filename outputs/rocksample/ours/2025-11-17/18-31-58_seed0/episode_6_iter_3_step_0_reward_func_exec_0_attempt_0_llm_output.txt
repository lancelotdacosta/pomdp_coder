Based on the provided samples, it seems that the reward function should only provide a positive reward of 10.0 and set `done` to `True` when the agent takes the `EXIT` action from a position where a rock is present and has been sampled. The current implementation incorrectly gives a reward of 10.0 and sets `done` to `True` whenever the `EXIT` action is taken, regardless of the agent's position.

To correct this, we need to ensure that the `EXIT` action only provides the reward and sets `done` to `True` if the agent is at a position where a rock has been sampled. Here is the improved `reward_func` function:

```python
def reward_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, next_state: RockSampleState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    
    # Check if the agent has taken the exit action and is at a rock position
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            return 10.0, True
        else:
            return 0.0, False
    
    # Check if the agent has sampled a rock
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            if state.rocks[rock_idx]:
                return 10.0, False  # Sampling a good rock gives a positive reward
            else:
                return -10.0, False  # Sampling a bad rock gives a negative reward
        else:
            return 0.0, False  # No rock at this position, no reward
    
    # Check if the agent has checked a rock
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        return -1.0, False  # Small penalty for checking a rock, regardless of position
    
    # For all other actions (move), there is no reward and the episode is not done
    return 0.0, False
```

This function now correctly checks whether the agent is at a rock position when taking the `EXIT` action. If the agent is not at a rock position, the `EXIT` action will not provide a reward or end the episode. This should align the model more closely with the observed distribution from the real world.
