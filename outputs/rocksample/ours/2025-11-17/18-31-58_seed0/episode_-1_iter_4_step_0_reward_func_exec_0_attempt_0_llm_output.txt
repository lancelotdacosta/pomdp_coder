The issue with the current `reward_func` is that it only checks if the agent is at the exit position `(4, 4)` when the `EXIT` action is taken. However, based on the provided samples, it seems that the agent can receive a reward of 10 and terminate the episode if it takes the `EXIT` action from any position along the rightmost column or bottom row (i.e., `x = 4` or `y = 4`).

To better model the true distribution, we need to update the reward function to check if the agent is in any of these positions when the `EXIT` action is taken.

Here is the improved `reward_func`:

```python
def reward_func(state: RockSampleState, action: int, next_state: RockSampleState) -> Tuple[float, bool]:
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    
    # Check if the agent has taken a sample action
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            if state.rocks[rock_idx]:
                # If the rock is good, the agent gets a reward of 10
                reward = 10.0
            else:
                # If the rock is bad, the agent gets a reward of -10
                reward = -10.0
        else:
            # If no rock is present, the agent gets no reward
            reward = 0.0
    elif action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        # If the agent exits, the episode ends
        done = True
        if state.x == 4 or state.y == 4:
            # If the agent is at any position along the rightmost column or bottom row, it gets a reward of 10
            reward = 10.0
        else:
            # Otherwise, it gets a reward of 0
            reward = 0.0
    elif action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        # If the agent checks a rock, it incurs a small penalty
        reward = -1.0
    else:
        # For all other actions (e.g., moving), there is no reward
        reward = 0.0
    
    # The episode is done if the agent exits from the exit position (4, 4)
    done = action == RockSampleActions.EXIT

    return reward, done
```

This updated function now correctly handles the `EXIT` action by checking if the agent is in any position along the rightmost column (`x = 4`) or bottom row (`y = 4`). If so, it grants a reward of 10 and marks the episode as done. Otherwise, it grants a reward of 0 but still marks the episode as done. This should align with the observed distribution from the real world.
