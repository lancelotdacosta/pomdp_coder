### Explanation of the Distribution of Next States Conditioned on Actions and Previous States:

1. **Move Actions**:
   - **MOVE_NORTH (0)**: The agent moves one step north, but stays within the grid bounds.
   - **MOVE_SOUTH (1)**: The agent moves one step south, but stays within the grid bounds.
   - **MOVE_EAST (2)**: The agent moves one step east, but stays within the grid bounds.
   - **MOVE_WEST (3)**: The agent moves one step west, but stays within the grid bounds.

2. **Sample Action**:
   - **SAMPLE (4)**: If the agent is at a rock's position, it samples the rock, changing its state from good to bad. If not at a rock, no change occurs.

3. **Exit Action**:
   - **EXIT (5)**: No change in state. This action is typically used to signal the end of an episode or to exit the current state without any further interaction.

4. **Check Rock Actions**:
   - **CHECK_ROCK_0 (6)** and **CHECK_ROCK_1 (7)**: If the agent is at the correct rock's position, the action does not change the state. If the agent is not at the rock, no change occurs.

The transition function ensures that the agent's movements are constrained within the grid, and actions like sampling and checking rocks only modify the state when the agent is at the correct position.
