Certainly! Based on the observed discrepancies between the real-world samples and the generated model, it seems that the reward and termination conditions need to be adjusted to better match the real-world behavior. Specifically, the reward for exiting the environment should depend on the agent's position, and the episode should only terminate when the agent exits at the correct location.

Here is the improved `reward_func` function:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    
    # Check if the agent has taken a sample action
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            if state.rocks[rock_idx]:
                # If the rock is good, the agent gets a reward of 10
                reward = 10.0
            else:
                # If the rock is bad, the agent gets a reward of -10
                reward = -10.0
        else:
            # If no rock is present, the agent gets no reward
            reward = 0.0
    elif action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        # If the agent exits, the episode ends
        done = True
        if state.x == 4 and state.y == 4:
            # If the agent is at (4, 4), it gets a reward of 10
            reward = 10.0
        else:
            # Otherwise, it gets a reward of 0
            reward = 0.0
    elif action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        # If the agent checks a rock, it incurs a small penalty
        reward = -1.0
    else:
        # For all other actions (e.g., moving), there is no reward
        reward = 0.0
    
    # The episode is done if the agent exits or reaches the exit position
    done = action == RockSampleActions.EXIT or (state.x == 4 and state.y == 4)

    return reward, done
```

### Explanation:
1. **Sampling Rocks**:
   - If the agent takes a `SAMPLE` action at a rock's position, the reward is determined by whether the rock is good or bad.
   - If no rock is present at the agent's current position, the reward is 0.

2. **Exiting the Environment**:
   - The episode terminates when the agent takes the `EXIT` action.
   - The reward for exiting depends on the agent's position:
     - If the agent is at (4, 4), it gets a reward of 10.
     - Otherwise, it gets a reward of 0.

3. **Checking Rocks**:
   - If the agent checks a rock, it incurs a small penalty of -1.

4. **Other Actions**:
   - For all other actions (e.g., moving), there is no reward.

5. **Episode Termination**:
   - The episode terminates if the agent exits or reaches the exit position (4, 4).

This should better align with the observed real-world samples and provide a more accurate model of the environment's reward and termination conditions.
