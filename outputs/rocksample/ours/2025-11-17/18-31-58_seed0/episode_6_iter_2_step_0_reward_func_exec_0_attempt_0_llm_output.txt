Certainly! Let's analyze the discrepancies and improve the `reward_func` function to better match the true distribution.

### Analysis

1. **Checking Rock Actions:**
   - The real world gives a penalty of `-1.0` for checking a rock, regardless of whether the agent is at the correct rock position or not.
   - Your model only gave a penalty if the agent was at the correct rock position and performed the corresponding check action.

2. **Exit Action:**
   - The real world gives a reward of `10.0` and terminates the episode when the agent performs the exit action at any rock position, not just the bottom-right corner.
   - Your model only gave a reward if the agent was at the bottom-right corner.

### Improved Reward Function

Here is the improved `reward_func` function to better match the true distribution:

```python
def reward_func(state, action, next_state):
    """
    Args:
        state (RockSampleState): the state of the environment
        action (int): the action to be executed
        next_state (RockSampleState): the next state of the environment
    Returns:
        reward (float): the reward of that state
        done (bool): whether the episode is done
    """
    
    # Check if the agent has taken the exit action
    if action == RockSampleActions.EXIT:
        return 10.0, True
    
    # Check if the agent has sampled a rock
    if action == RockSampleActions.SAMPLE:
        rock_idx = state.at_rock()
        if rock_idx is not None:
            if state.rocks[rock_idx]:
                return 10.0, False  # Sampling a good rock gives a positive reward
            else:
                return -10.0, False  # Sampling a bad rock gives a negative reward
        else:
            return 0.0, False  # No rock at this position, no reward
    
    # Check if the agent has checked a rock
    if action in CHECK_ACTIONS:
        return -1.0, False  # Small penalty for checking a rock, regardless of position
    
    # For all other actions (move), there is no reward and the episode is not done
    return 0.0, False
```

### Explanation

1. **Exit Action:**
   - The reward of `10.0` and the termination flag `True` are now given for any rock position when the exit action is performed.

2. **Checking Rock Actions:**
   - A penalty of `-1.0` is always applied for checking a rock, regardless of whether the agent is at the correct rock position or not.

This should align better with the true distribution provided in the examples.
