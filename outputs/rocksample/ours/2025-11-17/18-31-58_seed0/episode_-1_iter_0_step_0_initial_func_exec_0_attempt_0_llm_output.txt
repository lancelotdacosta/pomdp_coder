Based on the provided samples, it appears that the distribution of initial states for the RockSample environment involves:

1. The agent's starting position (x, y) can be any valid cell within the grid, excluding the walls.
2. The rocks' types (good or bad) are fixed at their respective positions and can be either good (G) or bad (B).

Given this information, we can model the initial state distribution by randomly selecting the agent's starting position and the types of the rocks.

Here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:

```python
def initial_func(empty_state: RockSampleState):
    """
    Input:
        empty_state (RockSampleState): An empty state with only the walls filled into the grid
    Returns:
        state (RockSampleState): the initial state of the environment
    """
    # Define the grid size and rock positions
    grid_size = GRID_SIZE
    rock_positions = ROCK_POSITIONS
    
    # Randomly select the agent's starting position
    x = random.randint(0, grid_size - 1)
    y = random.randint(0, grid_size - 1)
    
    # Ensure the selected position is not a wall (if any specific walls are defined)
    while (x, y) in rock_positions:  # Avoid placing the agent on a rock for simplicity
        x = random.randint(0, grid_size - 1)
        y = random.randint(0, grid_size - 1)
    
    # Randomly select the type of each rock (G or B)
    rocks = tuple(random.choice([True, False]) for _ in range(NUM_ROCKS))
    
    # Create and return the initial state
    return RockSampleState(x=x, y=y, rocks=rocks)
```

This function:
1. Randomly selects the agent's starting position within the grid.
2. Ensures the selected position is not on a rock for simplicity (though this can be adjusted if needed).
3. Randomly assigns a type (good or bad) to each rock.
4. Creates and returns the initial state based on the randomly chosen values.
