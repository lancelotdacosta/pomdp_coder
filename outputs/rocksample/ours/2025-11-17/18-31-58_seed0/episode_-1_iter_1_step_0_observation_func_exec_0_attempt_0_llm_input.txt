#define system
You are a robot exploring its environment. 



Your goal is to model the distribution of observations conditioned on a state of the world in python. 

You have tried it before and came up with one partially correct solution, but it is not perfect. 

The observed distribution disagrees with the generated model in several cases.
You need to improve your code to come closer to the true distribution.

Here is a solution you came up with before.

Here are some samples from the real world that were impossible under your model
Input RockSampleState: RockSampleState(x=0, y=3, rocks=[B,B])
Input int: 7
Output RockSampleObservation: Obs(x=0, y=3, rock=1, reading=BAD)



And here are some samples from your code under the same conditions
Input RockSampleState: RockSampleState(x=0, y=3, rocks=[B,B])
Input int: 7
Output RockSampleObservation: Obs(x=0,y=3, NULL)





Explain what you believe is the distribution of observations conditioned on a state in english, then improve your code to better model the true distribution.

Please implement the code for the following the template. 
You must implement the ‘ observation_func ‘ function. 

The code needs to be directly runnable with (state) and return a sample (observation). 

Do not output examples. 
Do not create any new classes. 
Do not rewrite existing classes.
Do not import any new modules from anywhere.
Do not list out specific indices that overfit to the examples, but include ranges.
Put the ‘ observation_func ‘ function in a python code block.
