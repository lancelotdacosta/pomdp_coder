Certainly! Let's first analyze the discrepancies between the observed real-world samples and the generated samples from your model.

### Analysis of Discrepancies

1. **Move North Action (Action 0)**:
   - Real World: `(x=1, y=1) -> (x=1, y=2)`
   - Model: `(x=1, y=1) -> (x=1, y=0)`
   
   - Real World: `(x=1, y=3) -> (x=1, y=4)`
   - Model: `(x=1, y=3) -> (x=1, y=2)`
   
   - Real World: `(x=0, y=2) -> (x=0, y=3)`
   - Model: `(x=0, y=2) -> (x=0, y=1)`
   
   - Real World: `(x=0, y=0) -> (x=0, y=1)`
   - Model: `(x=0, y=0) -> (x=0, y=0)`

   **Issue**: The real-world samples show that moving north increments the `y` coordinate, not decrements it. This suggests a misunderstanding of the direction.

2. **Move South Action (Action 1)**:
   - Real World: `(x=1, y=2) -> (x=1, y=1)`
   - Model: `(x=1, y=2) -> (x=1, y=3)`

   **Issue**: The real-world samples show that moving south decrements the `y` coordinate, not increments it. This is consistent with the opposite issue in the move north action.

### Corrected Distribution

- **Move North (Action 0)**: Should increment `y`.
- **Move South (Action 1)**: Should decrement `y`.

### Explanation

1. **Move North (Action 0)**: The `y` coordinate is incremented, but clamped to the grid size.
2. **Move South (Action 1)**: The `y` coordinate is decremented, but clamped to 0.
3. **Move East (Action 2)**: The `x` coordinate is incremented, but clamped to the grid size.
4. **Move West (Action 3)**: The `x` coordinate is decremented, but clamped to 0.
5. **Sample (Action 4)**: If the agent is at a rock, it changes the rock's state from good to bad.
6. **Exit (Action 5)**: No change in state.
7. **Check Rock Actions (Actions 6 and 7)**: If the agent is at the correct rock, no change in state. Otherwise, no change in state.

This should better align with the observed real-world samples and provide a more accurate model of the environment.
