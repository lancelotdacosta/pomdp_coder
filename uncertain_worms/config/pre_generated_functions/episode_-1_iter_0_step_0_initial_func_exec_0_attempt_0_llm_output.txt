Based on the provided samples, it appears that the initial states are distributed such that:

1. The agent can start at different positions within the grid, but always in an open cell (not a wall or goal).
2. The agent's direction is randomly chosen from the four possible directions (0: right, 1: down, 2: left, 3: up).
3. The grid is mostly empty, except for the walls and a single goal object.
4. The goal object is always placed in one of the cells, and its position can vary.

Given this understanding, we can model the distribution of initial states by selecting a random open cell for the agent's starting position and a random direction for the agent. We also need to ensure that the goal object is placed in a valid cell.

Here is the implementation of the `initial_func` function:

This function initializes the environment by:

5. Creating a new grid with the goal object placed at the selected cell.
6. Returning the new state with the updated grid, agent position, and direction.
